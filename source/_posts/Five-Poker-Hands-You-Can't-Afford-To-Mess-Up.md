#  Five Poker Hands You Can't Afford To Mess Up

A poker game is won or lost in the hands that are played. Make sure you don't make any of these five mistakes if you want to come out on top.

1. Folding too often

Folding is one of the most important decisions you'll make in a poker game, but it's also one of the more difficult ones to get right. If you fold too often, you're going to miss out on a lot of potential winning hands. On the other hand, if you stay in every hand, you're going to end up losing a lot of money. You need to find the balance between folding too much and folding too little.

2. Playing too many hands

On the other end of the spectrum, you can also lose games by playing too many hands. When you play too many hands, you're not giving yourself enough time to figure out what your opponents are holding, which means you're more likely to make mistakes. In addition, by playing more hands, you're also increasing your chances of losing money on busted draws.

3. Not betting enough

Not betting enough is another mistake that can cost you dearly in a poker game. If you don't bet enough, your opponents will have an advantage over you since they'll be able to see more cards without having to put any money at risk. In addition, by not betting enough, you're also making it easier for your opponents to bluff against you.

4. Bluffing too often

While bluffing can be a very effective tool in a poker game, it's also important not to bluff too often. If you bluff too often, your opponents will eventually catch on and start calling your bluffs every time. This will lead to a lot of money being lost on bad bets. Instead, try waiting for opportune moments before going all-in with a bluff.

#  How To Play Poker: The Nine Best Hands

When you’re just starting out playing poker, it can be tough to figure out what hands to play and which ones to fold. This guide will take you through the nine best hands in Texas Hold ’em so that you know what to look for when you’re sitting down at the table.

The best hand in poker is a royal flush, which is made up of an ace, king, queen, jack and ten of the same suit. This hand is unbeatable, so if you’re lucky enough to get dealt one, make sure to bet big!

A straight flush is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit, while a four of a kind is made up of four cards of the same rank. These are both very strong hands and should be played aggressively whenever possible.

A full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, while a flush is made up of five cards of the same suit. These are both good hands to play but shouldn’t be played too aggressively.

Two pair is made up of two cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, while a pair is made up of two cards of the same rank. These hands aren’t as strong as the hands listed above but they still offer some decent betting opportunities.

The final two hands - a high card and no pair - aren’t quite as strong as the others but they still have their place at the poker table. If you find yourself with a high card, try to raise your opponents as much as possible in order to win the pot uncontested. And if you don’t have any pairs or better, try to fold as soon as possible so that you don’t waste your chips.

#  Poker Strategy: When To Play 8s, 9s, And 10s

In poker, there are a number of different starting hands that players can be dealt. While there are some hands that are better than others, it's important to remember that every hand is beatable. That being said, there are a few hands that players should be more inclined to play than others.

The hands 8s, 9s, and 10s are all considered "medium" hands. They're not the best hands you can be dealt, but they're also not the worst. When deciding whether or not to play these hands, you'll need to take a number of factors into account.

The first factor to consider is your position at the table. If you're playing in late position (meaning that you're one of the last players to act), then you'll want to be more inclined to play these hands than if you're playing in early position. This is because players in late position have more information about what their opponents are holding, which means they can make better decisions about which hands to play.

The second factor to consider is the size of the pot. If the pot is small, then you'll want to be more inclined to fold these hands. However, if the pot is large, then you may want to consider playing them. This is because there's more money at stake and therefore it's worth taking a chance on these cards.

The third factor to consider is your opponent's stack size. If your opponent has a large stack size, then you'll want to be more inclined to fold these hands. This is because it's easier for your opponent to out-pot you if they have a lot of chips left. However, if your opponent has a small stack size, then you may want to consider playing them since your opponent won't be able to out-pot you very easily.

Ultimately, whether or not you should play 8s, 9s, and 10s depends on a number of factors. However, by keeping these factors in mind, you'll be able to make better decisions about whether or not these cards are worth playing.

#  The Three Worst Hands In Poker

In any game of poker, there will be hands that are worse than others. In this article, we will take a look at the three worst hands in poker.

# The Worst Hand In Poker

The absolute worst hand in poker is 2-2-7 unsuited. This hand has almost no potential for winning, and will likely lose you the majority of your chips if you decide to play it.

Other terrible hands include 3-3-8 unsuited and 4-4-9 unsuited. While these hands may have a bit more potential than 2-2-7, they are still not worth playing under most circumstances.

If you are lucky enough to get one of these hands, it is usually best to fold immediately and save yourself the embarrassment. There are much better hands to be playing in most cases.

#  How To Play Poker: The Five Best Hands

There are a multitude of poker games and variants, but the most popular by far is Texas hold’em. In this game, players are dealt two cards (hole cards) face down and share five community cards dealt face up in the middle of the table. The aim is to make the best 5-card hand using any two hole cards and any three of the five community cards.

Here are the five best hands in Texas hold’em, from weakest to strongest:

1. Two pair

This is a hand with two different pairs, for example 2♥2♦3♣3♠. The rank of the two pairs is important – for example, 2♥2♦9♥9♣ would be a better hand than 2♦2♥3♦3♠. As a general rule, the rank of the two pairs is as follows: higher pair > lower pair > king high > ace high.

2. One pair

This is a hand with just one pair, for example 4♦4♥7♦7♣. The rank of the pair is important – for example, 4♦4♥A♥K♠ would be a better hand than 7♦7♣Q♦J♠. As a general rule, the rank of the pair is as follows: higher pair > lower pair > queen high > jack high.

3. Straight

This is a hand with five consecutive card ranks, for example 3♥4♥5♣6♦7♠ (or 10♣J♦Q♥K♣A♦ if you’re playing lowball). An ace can count as either high or low (so A-2-3-4-5 and 3-2-1-0-9 are both straights), but it cannot wrap around (so Q-K-A-2-3 would not be a straight). The rank of the straight is important – for example, 6♥7♦8♥9♠10♣ would be a better hand than 3♦4♣5♥6♣7♦. Straights always beat flushes and three of a kind.

4. Flush

This is a hand with five cards all of the same suit, for example 9♥10♥J♥Q♥K♦. The rank of the flush is not important – so 9♥10♥6♠8♦3◊ would be just as good as 9♦10♣J♦Q◊K♠. Flushes always beat straights and four of a kind.

5. Four of a kind

This is a hand with four cards all of the same rank, for example K♥K♦Q♦Q◊ or J◊8●7●6◊. As you might expect, fours of a kind always beat everything else apart from royal flushes (see below).

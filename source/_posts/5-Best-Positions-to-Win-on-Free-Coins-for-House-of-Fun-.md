#  Winning at the House of Fun: Easy tips for the top five positions 

If you’re looking to get ahead in the popular casino game House of Fun, look no further. This guide contains easy tips for each of the five top positions in the game. 

#1: The Top Spot – The first spot on the board is always the most advantageous, and the same is true in House of Fun. To maximize your earnings, make sure to aim for this spot every time.

#2: Left Side – The left side of the board is also a desirable spot, as it provides good protection against attacks from other players. If you can manage to occupy this area, you’ll be able to block your opponents and protect your own earnings.

#3: Bottom Corner – The bottom corner is another excellent spot to aim for, as it puts you in a strategic position while also providing good protection. Make sure to keep an eye on your opponents and strike when they’re least expecting it.

#4: Center – The center of the board is a risky place to be, but it can also be very rewarding if you play your cards right. Make sure to keep an eye on both the left and right sides of the board, and always be prepared for a sneak attack.

#5: Right Side – The right side of the board is the last place you want to be, as it leaves you vulnerable to attacks from other players. If you can manage to hold out until the end of the game, however, you may be able to claim victory by taking out your opponents one by one.

#  How to win in House of Fun: Position yourself for success! 

There are some notable things to keep in mind when playing the popular Facebook game, House of Fun. If you position yourself correctly, you can set yourself up for success! 

One important thing to remember is that coins are essential for progressing through the levels. You can earn coins in a variety of ways, but the most common way is by completing quests. It’s important to start completing quests as early as possible so that you can stockpile coins for future progress.

Another important thing to keep in mind is that activating bonus missions will help you progress much more quickly. The bonus missions are located in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen and they include tasks such as spinning a certain number of times or collecting a certain number of items. Completing these bonus missions will give you a large number of coins, which will help you move on to the next level more quickly.

It’s also important to pay attention to the different types of rooms that are available in the game. The key is to build rooms that will generate coins for you while you’re away. For example, the casino room will give you a small amount of coins every few minutes, so it’s a good idea to add this room to your lineup. The same goes for other rooms such as the gift shop and the juice bar.

Finally, remember to use your friends’ help! Friends can help by sending you free gifts, which will give you a boost in your quest for success.

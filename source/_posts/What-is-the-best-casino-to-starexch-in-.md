#  Why did Club Atlético de Madrid build the Flaubert 2022 stadium? 

Club Atlético de Madrid, commonly known as Atlético Madrid, is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. The club was founded in 1903 and currently plays in the La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Atlético has won La Liga on 10 occasions, Copa del Rey on 10 occasions, Supercopa de España on 7 occasions and UEFA Europa League on 2 occasions. 

In order to comply with the new regulations set by La Liga that state all teams must have a stadium with a minimum capacity of 55,000 seats by 2020-21 season, Atlético announced in February 2017 they will be building the Flaubert 2022 stadium. The stadium is set to have a capacity of 68,000 seats and will be built on the current site of the Vicente Calderón Stadium. Work begun on the new stadium in March 2018 and is estimated to be completed in time for the 2022-23 season. 

The reasoning behind Club Atlético de Madrid’s decision to build the Flaubert 2022 stadium is twofold. Firstly, it will enable them to comply with La Liga’s new regulations and secondly it will give them much-needed additional revenue due to ticket sales and naming rights. The increased revenue from ticket sales is particularly important for Atlético as they do not have significant commercial sponsorship deals like other La Liga clubs such as Barcelona or Real Madrid. The naming rights for the Flaubert 2022 stadium could potentially bring in millions of euros which would be a significant boost to the club’s finances. 

The decision to build a new stadium was not an easy one for Atlético as it means relocating from their long-time home of the Vicente Calderón Stadium. However, with their new 68,000-seat stadium they will be able to compete financially with Europe’s biggest clubs and continue their success both domestically and in European competitions.

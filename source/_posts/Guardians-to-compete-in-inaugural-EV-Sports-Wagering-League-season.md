#  Guardians to compete in inaugural EV Sports Wagering League season

Las Vegas, NV - The Guardians are pleased to announce that they will compete in the inaugural EV Sports Wagering League (ESWL) season. This new professional eSports league will feature teams competing in the latest video games for the chance to win large cash prizes.

"It is an honor to be one of the first teams to compete in the ESWL," said Guardians captain Carlos "C-Money" Morales. "Our team is looking forward to testing our skills against the best in the business."

The Guardians will compete in the following games during the ESWL season:

- Call of Duty: Modern Warfare
- League of Legends
- Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
- Fortnite

The ESWL is modeled after traditional sports leagues such as the NBA, NFL, and MLB. Teams will compete in a regular season followed by a playoff tournament. The top teams from each game will receive a postseason payout.

The ESWL is backed by some of the biggest names in eSports including Turner Sports, WME | IMG, and FaZe Clan. The league has already secured broadcasting deals with several major networks including ESPN, TNT, and TBS. The inaugural season is scheduled to begin in September 2019.

#  Guardians scouting new talent for upcoming season

Guardians of the Galaxy are looking for new talent for their upcoming season. After the loss of several players in the off-season, the team is looking for new blood to fill the empty spots.

The Guardians are a relatively new team in the cosmic scene. The first season was full of surprises, with the team making it to the finals before losing to the Avengers. This season, they are looking to redeem themselves and take home the championship.

They are holding open tryouts for anyone who thinks they have what it takes to be a guardian. The tryouts will be held in Los Angeles on November 12th. If you are interested in trying out, visit [this website](https://www.tryoutguardians.com/) for more information.

#  Guardians looking to improve on last season's results

Coming off a season in which they reached the Finals, the Guardians are looking to improve on their results this year. "We're not content with just making it to the Finals," said team captain Brandon "Pride" Chen. "We want to win the whole thing."

The Guardians kicked off their season with a decisive victory over the Renegades, showing that they are serious about their goals this year. "We came out firing on all cylinders," said jungler Nam "LirA" Tae-yoo. "We want to make sure that we're at our best from the start of the season."

While the victory over the Renegades was impressive, the Guardians know that they will need to continue to improve if they want to reach their goals. "There's still room for improvement," said Chen. "We need to work on our macro play and make sure that we're playing as a team."

The Guardians will have their first chance to prove themselves against top competition when they take on Team Liquid next week.

#  Guardians ready to take on the competition in the EV Sports Wagering League

The Guardians are an up and coming team in the EV Sports Wagering League. Led by superstar quarterback Matt Ryan, they are ready to take on the competition. The team has a young but talented roster, which will help them to compete against some of the best teams in the league.

The Guardians have a strong offense, led by Ryan. He is one of the most prolific quarterbacks in the league, and he is surrounded by a talented group of receivers. The team also has a solid running game, which will help to keep defenses off balance.

The defense is also solid, with a strong pass rush and a good secondary. They will need to be sharp against some of the high-powered offenses in the league.

The Guardians are looking forward to competing in the EV Sports Wagering League this season. They feel confident that they can compete against any team in the league and come out victorious.

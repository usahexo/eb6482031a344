#  When Will Arizona Sports Betting Start? Check Back for Updates

It has been a little while since the US Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May of 2018. This monumental decision paved the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.

Since then, there has been a flurry of activity as states scramble to get their sports betting laws in order. Delaware was the first state to begin accepting bets in June, followed by New Jersey in July. Many other states are currently in the process of drafting and passing legislation, but it is taking longer than expected due to various complexities (e.g., how to deal with interstate betting, what taxes to charge, etc.).

Arizona is one of the states that is still working on its sports betting legislation. The Arizona Senate passed SB 1113 on February 14th, 2019. The bill allows for mobile and online sports betting, as well as physical sportsbooks. However, there are still some steps that need to be taken before it can become law.

The first step is for the House of Representatives to approve the bill. They will likely do so, but there could be some amendments made first. Once it is approved by the House, it goes back to the Senate for a final vote. If it passes both chambers, Governor Doug Ducey will have 10 days to sign it into law.

Assuming everything goes smoothly, Arizona could have legalized sports betting by the end of March or early April. There are already a few casinos lining up to offer sports betting once it becomes legal, including Casino del Sol in Tucson and Gila River Casinos in Laveen and Glendale.

So far, most of the discussion around Arizona's SB 1113 has been about how much money the state stands to make from taxes on gambling revenues. Although this is certainly an important consideration, there are also other aspects of sports betting that need to be taken into account.

For example, how will this affect consumers? Will people who would normally not gamble start placing bets? How will this impact businesses that have nothing to do with gambling (e.g., bars and restaurants)? What kind of social costs might be associated with legalized sports betting? These are all important questions that need to be answered before any decisions are made about passing SB 1113 into law.

#  AZ Gambling Commission Approves Sports Betting in Time for NFL Season

The AZ Gambling Commission has given the green light to sports betting, just in time for the start of the NFL season.

Commissioners voted unanimously on September 12 to approve regulations that would allow casinos in the state to offer sports betting. The regulations will now go to the state legislature for final approval.

"It is great news that Arizona is getting in line with the majority of states that have already legalized some form of sports betting," said Republican State Senator Sonny Borrelli, who sponsored the legislation. "This will create jobs and generate new revenue for our state."

Under the proposed regulations, casinos would be able to offer betting on professional and college sports, as well as other sporting events such as golf and auto racing. Bettors would be able to place wagers through kiosks, mobile apps, or at tables in casino lounges.

Residents of Arizona have been eager for authorization of sports betting, which was made legal nationwide by the US Supreme Court in May. A recent statewide poll found that 58 percent of Arizonans supported legalization of sports betting.

Casinos in the state are expected to begin offering sports betting within 90 days of final legislative approval.

#  AZ Sports Betting Bills Head to Governor's Desk for Signature

The Arizona State Legislature has sent two bills regulating sports betting to the Governor’s desk for signature.

HB 2005 passed the Senate in a 20-10 vote and the House in a 45-12 vote. The bill would allow casinos and race tracks to operate sportsbooks, while tribes would be able to offer sports betting through their casinos. Online sports betting is not allowed under the bill.

SB 1175 also passed the Senate in a 20-10 vote and the House in a 44-14 vote. This bill allows for mobile and online sports betting, with a 15% tax on gaming revenue. There is also a 0.25% fee charged on bets placed within state borders.

Governor Doug Ducey is expected to sign both bills into law,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) making Arizona the latest state to legalize some form of sports betting.

# AZ Sports Bettors Can Start Making Bets on Monday

The Arizona Gaming Commission has given the final OK to start sports betting in the state. The first bets will be placed on Monday, November 26th. The move makes Arizona the sixth state to allow full-scale sports betting, joining Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico and West Virginia.

There are some restrictions on which bets can be placed. Bettors can only wager on games that have already taken place. They can also only bet on the outcome of the game, not on specific players or teams. Wagering on college games is prohibited, but all other professional and amateur games are fair game.

State officials are expecting a major windfall from sports betting. Estimates range from $50 million to $100 million per year in new revenue. That would be a significant boost to the state's coffers, which could be used to help fund education or other important programs.

Not everyone is happy about the new development, of course. Some people worry that it will lead to more gambling addiction and problems with compulsive behavior. Others argue that it will simply add to the noise and chaos of sports fandom and won't really do much good in terms of generating revenue for the state.

Time will tell who is right and who is wrong about sports betting in Arizona. But for now, at least, AZ residents can start making their picks and placing their bets!

#  Arizona Becomes Latest State to Legalize Sports Betting

Arizona Governor Doug Ducey on Monday signed a bill allowing sports betting in the state, making it the fourth in the nation to do so after New Jersey, Delaware, and Mississippi.

"This is a historic day for Arizona," Ducey said in a statement. "Along with our office of tourism, we intend to use this law to promote responsible gaming and attract new visitors to our great state."

The bill allows people 21 years or older to bet on sporting events at casinos, race tracks, and tribal lands. The state will also collect revenue from licensing fees and taxes on bets.

Supporters of the measure say it will help generate new revenue for the state, particularly at a time when revenues from traditional gambling sources are declining. The American Gaming Association estimates that sports betting could generate up to $7 billion in annual revenue nationwide.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and other social ills.

New Jersey was the first state to legalize sports betting following a Supreme Court decision last year that struck down a federal ban on the activity. Since then, three other states have followed suit.

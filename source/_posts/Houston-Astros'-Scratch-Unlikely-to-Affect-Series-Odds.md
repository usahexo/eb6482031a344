#  Houston Astros' Scratch Unlikely to Affect Series Odds

Houston Astros' manager A.J. Hinch scratched shortstop Carlos Correa from the starting lineup about an hour before game time Wednesday against the Boston Red Sox. Correa is dealing with soreness in his right side, according to Hinch.

This news is unlikely to have much of an impact on series odds, which have the Red Sox as -155 favorites (bet $155 to win $100) and the Astros at +135 (bet $100 to win $135).

Even if Correa had started, he would not have been 100 percent due to the injury. It's unclear at this point how long he'll be sidelined. The Astros will likely give him some time off to rest and heal up.

In his absence, Marwin Gonzalez will likely get the start at shortstop. Gonzalez has been a versatile player for Houston this season, playing all over the diamond. He's hit .278 with 13 homers and 52 RBIs in 115 games.

Gonzalez is a good hitter but he doesn't have the power of Correa. This could mean more opportunities for players like Evan Gattis and Yuli Gurriel in the lineup against Boston starting pitcher David Price.

The Red Sox have had their sights set on winning the World Series since before the season even started. They acquired ace pitcher Chris Sale in a trade with the Chicago White Sox in December and have built one of the best bullpens in baseball.

Boston is also getting strong contributions from its young players like Xander Bogaerts, Mookie Betts and Jackie Bradley Jr. The team looks primed to make a deep run into October.

#  Astros Scratch Pitcher; Who Pitches in Relief?

When Houston Astros pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. was scratched from his Wednesday game with discomfort in his right elbow, many people were wondering who would take his place. McCullers is one of the Astros’ top starters, so losing him for any length of time is a significant blow.

Reliever Chris Devenski was the first option to take McCullers’ spot in the rotation. He has been one of the most reliable pitchers out of the bullpen for the Astros this season, and he has starting experience. However, manager A.J. Hinch decided to go with another reliever instead.

Will Harris will be taking McCullers’ spot in the rotation on Wednesday. Harris is also a reliever who has been pitching well for Houston this season. He has a 2-1 record and 2.05 ERA in 33 appearances this year.

The move to start Harris on Wednesday might be a sign that Hinch is considering using Devenski as a reliever for the remainder of the playoffs. Devenski could be used in long relief or as a closer if needed, depending on how the rest of the playoffs play out.

Harris said he was ready to start if needed and that he was looking forward to getting an opportunity to pitch in a playoff game. “You always want to be out there, especially when it’s meaningful games like this,” Harris said. “You dream about being in these situations when you’re growing up as a little leaguer, so I’m definitely looking forward to it and I’ll do whatever I can do to help us win.”

Houston will need all hands on deck as they try to win their first World Series title this year. The Astros are currently up 2-0 against the Boston Red Sox in the best-of-five American League Championship Series (ALCS). McCullers is expected to be available for Game 3 or 4 of the ALCS, depending on how he feels after his next few bullpen sessions.

#  Vegas slight favorite after Astros scratch starter

Houston Astros pitcher Justin Verlander will not start Game 1 of the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday due to a sore right groin.

The Dodgers are now slight favorites to win the series, according to Las Vegas odds makers.

The Astros scratched Verlander just hours before Game 1 was set to begin. Instead, they will send Dallas Keuchel to the mound. The Dodgers have not yet announced a starter for Game 1.

Verlander sustained the injury in his last start of the regular season and had been trying to rehab it without surgery. He threw a bullpen session on Sunday and said he was still experiencing some pain.

"I don't think it's smart to push it this early in the season," Verlander said after the bullpen session. "I think we're all on the same page with that."

Keuchel will be pitching on three days' rest after starting Houston's 5-1 victory over Boston in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series last Wednesday.

#  Public still betting on Astros, despite early scratch

The Houston Astros have been a powerhouse in the American League for the past few seasons. Even after starting the season with a mediocre record, the team is still among the favorites to win the World Series.

The Astros started their campaign with an embarrassing 1-5 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays. This put them in last place in their division, but they are still expected to turn things around.

Houston’s current odds of winning the World Series are at +650, according to SportsBettingDime. This gives them the sixth-best odds in baseball.

Some people may be tempted to bet on other teams after seeing the Astros start out so poorly. However, there is still a lot of time for them to make a comeback.

Houston has one of the best lineups in all of baseball. They also have one of the most dominant pitchers in Justin Verlander. If he can continue his strong play, then the Astros stand a good chance of making it to the playoffs.

There are still plenty of games left in the season, and Houston can easily make up ground if they play well from here on out.

#  Despite scratch, Astros remain Vegas favorites

Houston Astros (-180)

Los Angeles Dodgers (+160)

The Houston Astros are coming off of an impressive World Series victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers, but they’re not the favorites to win it all in 2019. According to Vegas, that title still belongs to the Astros, who are listed as -180 favorites. The Dodgers, meanwhile, are +160 underdogs.

There’s no denying that the Astros have a stacked roster heading into next season. Jose Altuve, George Springer and Alex Bregman are just a few of the stars on this team. Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole are also back for another season. The Dodgers, however, aren’t ones to be taken lightly either. They boast an impressive lineup of their own, led by Clayton Kershaw and Cody Bellinger.

It should be another exciting season of baseball. Will the Astros repeat as champions? Or will the Dodgers finally get their revenge? Only time will tell.

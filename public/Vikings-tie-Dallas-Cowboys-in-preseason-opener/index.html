        <h1 id="Vikings-tie-Dallas-Cowboys-in-preseason-opener"><a href="#Vikings-tie-Dallas-Cowboys-in-preseason-opener" class="headerlink" title="Vikings tie Dallas Cowboys in preseason opener"></a>Vikings tie Dallas Cowboys in preseason opener</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings opened their preseason schedule on Friday evening with a 17-17 tie against the Dallas Cowboys. The team’s starters played sparingly, with only a few drives before being replaced by the backups.</p>
<p>The first points of the game came from a blocked punt by rookie Holton Hill that was recovered in the end zone by Brian Robison for a touchdown. However, the Vikings would only hold onto that lead for a few minutes as Dak Prescott and the Cowboys offense marched down the field to score on a one-yard run by Ezekiel Elliott.</p>
<p>After forcing Dallas to punt on their next possession, the Vikings took over at their own 42-yard line. Kirk Cousins completed a six-yard pass to Stefon Diggs on the first play of the drive before handing off to Dalvin Cook for 18 yards. Two plays later, Cousins hit Kyle Rudolph for an 11-yard touchdown pass to give Minnesota a 14-7 lead.</p>
<p>Early in the second quarter, Daniel Carlson connected on a 52-yard field goal to extend Minnesota’s lead to 17-7. The Cowboys responded with a touchdown drive of their own, capped off by Prescott finding Elliott in the end zone for his second score of the night.</p>
<p>With both teams’ starters sitting out most of the rest of the game, neither team was able to find much success offensively. The only other points scored were two more field goals by Carlson as time expired in both halves.</p>
<p>In all, there were plenty of positives for Minnesota to takeaway from this game. Cousins looked sharp in his limited action, completing 11 of 15 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown. Diggs also looked good catching five balls for 56 yards. The offensive line held up well against Dallas’ vaunted defensive front and Cook showed flashes of his potential as well, running for 56 yards on nine carries.</p>
<p>The biggest concern coming out of this game was probably the performance of the defense. They allowed Prescott and Elliott to march down the field at will and didn’t generate much pressure on either quarterback. There are still plenty of things that need to be sorted out before Week 1 but this game was certainly a good starting point.</p>
<h1 id="Vikings-looking-to-rebound-after-disappointing-2015-season"><a href="#Vikings-looking-to-rebound-after-disappointing-2015-season" class="headerlink" title="Vikings looking to rebound after disappointing 2015 season"></a>Vikings looking to rebound after disappointing 2015 season</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings will be looking to rebound in 2016 after a disappointing 2015 season.</p>
<p>The Vikings finished the year with a record of 7-9, which was good for last place in the NFC North.</p>
<p>Minnesota’s offense was one of the worst in the league last year, averaging just 17.5 points per game.</p>
<p>The Vikings will need to improve their offensive scoring output if they hope to compete in the NFC North this season.</p>
<p>Minnesota’s defense was one of the best in the NFL last year, allowing just 18.9 points per game.</p>
<p>The Vikings will need their defense to carry them again this season if they want to make the playoffs.</p>
<p>Minnesota has some talented players on their roster, including quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, running back Adrian Peterson, and linebacker Chad Greenway.</p>
<p>If Bridgewater can take another step forward in his development and Peterson can return to his old form, the Vikings could have a very successful season.</p>
<p>However, there are also some question marks on the roster, including defensive end Brian Robison and wide receiver Charles Johnson.</p>
<p>If Robison and Johnson can’t produce this year, it could be another long season for the Vikings.</p>
<p>Overall, I expect the Vikings to rebound nicely in 2016 and contend for a playoff spot in the NFC North.</p>
<h1 id="Siemian-named-starting-quarterback-for-Vikings"><a href="#Siemian-named-starting-quarterback-for-Vikings" class="headerlink" title="Siemian named starting quarterback for Vikings"></a>Siemian named starting quarterback for Vikings</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings have announced that Trevor Siemian will be the starting quarterback for the team this season. This comes as a bit of a surprise, as many had expected the team to go with either Kirk Cousins or Drew Brees.</p>
<p>Siemian, who was acquired in a trade with the Denver Broncos earlier this year, has only thrown two passes in his career. He played in seven games for the Broncos last season, completing 59.3 percent of his passes for 1,401 yards, nine touchdowns, and 10 interceptions.</p>
<p>Despite his lack of experience, head coach Mike Zimmer is confident in Siemian’s ability. “He has a lot of natural leadership qualities and he’s worked very hard,” Zimmer said. “I think he’ll do a good job.”</p>
<p>Zimmer’s confidence is likely due to Siemian’s familiarity with offensive coordinator John DeFilippo’s system. DeFilippo was the quarterbacks coach for the Broncos when Siemian was there.</p>
<p>The Vikings open their preseason schedule on Thursday night against the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
<h1 id="Hill-leads-Vikings-to-preseason-victory-over-San-Francisco-49ers"><a href="#Hill-leads-Vikings-to-preseason-victory-over-San-Francisco-49ers" class="headerlink" title="Hill leads Vikings to preseason victory over San Francisco 49ers"></a>Hill leads Vikings to preseason victory over San Francisco 49ers</h1><p>Led by quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and running back Adrian Peterson, the Minnesota Vikings defeated the San Francisco 49ers 13-3 in their preseason opener on Sunday.</p>
<p>Bridgewater completed six of seven passes for 92 yards, while Peterson rushed for 33 yards on six carries.</p>
<p>“It was great to see Teddy out there making plays,” Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer said. “He has been working hard.”</p>
<p>Vikings linebacker Eric Kendricks led all players with nine tackles, while cornerback Xavier Rhodes had an interception.</p>
<p>“I thought our defense played well,” Zimmer said. “We had some good pressure on the quarterback.”</p>
<p>49ers quarterback Blaine Gabbert completed 11 of 18 passes for 135 yards. He also threw an interception.</p>
<p>“I thought we moved the ball well at times,” 49ers head coach Chip Kelly said. “But we turned it over too many times.”</p>
<h1 id="Murray-looks-to-build-on-successful-rookie-season-with-Vikings"><a href="#Murray-looks-to-build-on-successful-rookie-season-with-Vikings" class="headerlink" title="Murray looks to build on successful rookie season with Vikings"></a>Murray looks to build on successful rookie season with Vikings</h1><p>Running back Dalvin Cook is one of the Minnesota Vikings most important players, and he will be looking to build on a successful rookie season in 2018.</p>
<p>Cook was drafted by the Vikings in the second round of the 2017 NFL Draft, and he made an immediate impact, rushing for 354 yards and two touchdowns in his first four games. However, Cook suffered a torn ACL in Week 4 and was forced to miss the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>Despite being limited to just four games, Cook still finished as the Vikings’ leading rusher, and he will be looking to build on that success in 2018. He has looked good during offseason workouts and training camp, and he is expected to be a key contributor for the Vikings this season.</p>
<p>The Vikings have high hopes for Cook this season, and they believe that he can become one of the top running backs in the NFL. He has already shown that he has the potential to be a superstar, and if he can stay healthy, there is no doubt that he will make a big impact for the Vikings this year.</p>

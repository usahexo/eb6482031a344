<p>The criticism surfaced in the wake of reports that an Atlantic City casino paid out $1.5 million to a gambler who suffered from a gambling problem. Casino officials say that they are not at fault, and that the gambler should have known better than to keep gambling after he had already lost millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction advocates, however, say that the casinos are responsible for the problem because they allow people to continue gambling even after they have lost large sums of money. They argue that the casinos should be more proactive in identifying problem gamblers and helping them to get treatment.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the casinos of Atlantic City have come under fire for their role in addiction. In 2012, a state task force released a report criticizing the casinos for failing to address problem gambling. The report found that two-thirds of people who gamble in Atlantic City have a problem with gambling, and called on the casinos to do more to help these people.</p>
<p>Casino officials argue that they cannot be held responsible for the actions of problem gamblers. They say that it is up to individuals to control their own behavior, and that the casinos are simply providing a service that is legal and enjoyed by many people.</p>
<h1 id="How-Atlantic-City-Casinos-Enable-Gambling-Addicts"><a href="#How-Atlantic-City-Casinos-Enable-Gambling-Addicts" class="headerlink" title="How Atlantic City Casinos Enable Gambling Addicts"></a>How Atlantic City Casinos Enable Gambling Addicts</h1><p>Atlantic City has been a popular destination for gambling since the mid-19th century, when people would come by boat from New York City to gamble in the city’s casinos. The city’s casinos were a major boon to its economy until the early 21st century, when competition from casinos in other states began to erode their market share.</p>
<p>In an effort to compete, the casinos in Atlantic City began to offer more and more games of chance, including slot machines and electronic table games. As a result, the proportion of casino revenue that comes from these games has increased dramatically in recent years.</p>
<p>While some people may enjoy playing these games occasionally, for others they can be addictive. Studies have shown that people who are addicted to gambling are more likely to exhibit signs of problem gambling behaviour, including lying about their losses, stealing money to gamble with, and neglecting important responsibilities in order to gamble.</p>
<p>The casinos in Atlantic City enable problem gambling behaviour by offering these games of chance. Their aggressive marketing of these games contributes to the problem, as does their refusal to limit how much people can bet or lose.</p>
<p>Casinos should take responsibility for the harm that they cause by enabling problem gambling and should take steps to address the issue. This could include limiting how much people can bet or lose on these games, providing information about how to gamble responsibly, and providing help for those who have a gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="The-Atlantic-A-Haven-for-Gambling-Addicts"><a href="#The-Atlantic-A-Haven-for-Gambling-Addicts" class="headerlink" title="The Atlantic: A Haven for Gambling Addicts"></a>The Atlantic: A Haven for Gambling Addicts</h1><p>Atlantic City, long known as a popular coastal resort town, is also home to one of the country’s largest gambling industries. The legalization of gambling in Atlantic City in the 1970s turned the city into a gambling destination, and its casinos now bring in more revenue than those in any other city in the United States.</p>
<p>But while the casinos have brought jobs and money to the city, they have also had a dark side: they have drawn in large numbers of problem gamblers, who have caused significant social and economic problems for Atlantic City and its residents.</p>
<p>A recent study by the University of Nevada at Reno found that Atlantic City has the highest concentration of problem gamblers in the country. The study looked at data from across the country on things like casino revenue, pathological gambling rates, and crime rates. It found that Atlantic City had nearly twice as many problem gamblers as Las Vegas, which is often thought of as the country’s gambling capital.</p>
<p>The study also found that Atlantic City’s problem gamblers are causing significant social and economic problems for the city. These include crime (such as theft and robbery), unemployment, poverty, and mental health problems.</p>
<p>Problem gambling is a serious issue that can have very negative consequences for individuals, families, and communities. It is estimated that about two percent of Americans are pathological gamblers, while another four percent are considered “problem gamblers.” This means that there are millions of people who are affected by problem gambling each year.</p>
<p>Problem gambling can lead to financial problems, job loss, and even homelessness. It can also lead to marital problems and violence both inside and outside of the home. And it can cause significant mental health problems, including depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>The effects of problem gambling can be far-reaching, touching not just those who are directly affected but also their friends and family members. The University of Nevada at Reno study found that about 14 percent of Atlantic City residents have a relative who is a problem gambler, which is significantly higher than the national average of eight percent.</p>
<p>It is clear that problem gambling is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. In Atlantic City, this means taking steps to reduce the number of problem gamblers who live there. This could include increasing awareness about the dangers of problem gambling and providing resources for those who need help dealing with their addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Industry-Fuelling-Gambling-Addiction-Epidemic"><a href="#Casino-Industry-Fuelling-Gambling-Addiction-Epidemic" class="headerlink" title="Casino Industry Fuelling Gambling Addiction Epidemic"></a>Casino Industry Fuelling Gambling Addiction Epidemic</h1><p>A growing number of people are becoming addicted to gambling, with the casino industry fuelling the epidemic. In Australia, for example, it is estimated that around 80,000 people are addicted to gambling, with the problem costing the country $4.7 billion each year.</p>
<p>Casinos are specifically designed to encourage gambling, with games that are littered with bets of all sizes in order to lure people in. Once someone is hooked on gambling, they can quickly find themselves spending hours at a time playing games and losing money they can’t afford to lose.</p>
<p>The effects of gambling addiction can be devastating both financially and emotionally. Addicts can lose their jobs, homes and relationships as they sink further into their addiction. Families can also be torn apart as loved ones struggle to come to terms with their loved one’s addiction.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways that people can become addicted to gambling. Some may start off by betting small amounts of money but eventually find themselves betting larger and larger sums as their addiction takes hold. Others may develop a dependence on gambling in order to cope with stress or boredom.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have a damaging impact on both individuals and society as a whole. It is important that those affected by gambling get help from professionals in order to break free from their addiction and rebuild their lives.</p>
<h1 id="enabling-gambling-addiction-in-atlantic-city"><a href="#enabling-gambling-addiction-in-atlantic-city" class="headerlink" title="enabling gambling addiction in atlantic city"></a>enabling gambling addiction in atlantic city</h1><p>The legalization of gambling in Atlantic City in 1976 was supposed to be a financial boon for the city. However, many legislators did not foresee the addictive potential of gambling and its negative impact on residents’ quality of life. As a result, Atlantic City has become one of the leaders in gambling addiction rates in the United States.</p>
<p>Gambling is a form of entertainment that is designed to give people an adrenaline rush. The potential rewards are also a major draw for people who are susceptible to addiction. When someone becomes addicted to gambling, their life starts to revolve around it. They may lose interest in other activities, start lying about their whereabouts, and experience mood swings or financial problems as a result of their addiction.</p>
<p>The most common type of problem gambler is the “action seeker”. This person is motivated by the thrill of gambling and the potential for big winnings. They often have difficulty controlling their spending and end up taking bigger and bigger risks in order to get that high feeling. As their addiction progresses, they may lose touch with reality and start engaging in criminal activity in order to get money to gamble with.</p>
<p>Atlantic City was once known as the “Las Vegas of the East Coast”, but now it is better known for its high rate of gambling addiction. There are approximately 15,000 problem gamblers living in Atlantic City, which amounts to 8% of the population. Gambling addiction has been linked to increased levels of crime, poverty, and suicide.</p>
<p>It is not clear why Atlantic City has such a high rate of gambling addiction, but some experts believe that it has something to do with the fact that there are so many casinos located there. The close proximity of so many casinos creates an environment where it is easy to get hooked on gambling. Additionally, there are few barriers to entry – anyone can walk into a casino and start playing games.</p>
<p>The state government has taken steps to address the issue of gambling addiction in Atlantic City, but more needs to be done. There needs to be greater regulation of casinos and more education about the dangers of gambling addiction. In addition, there should be more support available for people who are struggling with this disorder.</p>

<p>“Gambling is a serious crime that ruins families and harms our communities,” said Hood. “This new initiative will help protect Mississippians from the dangers of illegal gambling and create a safer environment for all residents.”</p>
<p>The Attorney General’s Office will work with local law enforcement agencies to identify and investigate illegal gambling operations. The office will also work with the Mississippi Gaming Commission to prosecute offenders.</p>
<p>“The Mississippi Gaming Commission is pleased to partner with the Attorney General’s Office in this important initiative,” said Gaming Commission Executive Director Allen Godfrey. “Illegal gambling undermines the integrity of our gaming industry and puts the public at risk. We applaud Attorney General Hood for his commitment to address this problem.”</p>
<p>Illegal gambling can include anything from casino-style games played in private homes to sports betting over the internet. It is a felony offense to engage in illegal gambling in Mississippi, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<h1 id="10-People-Arrested-in-Raid-on-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-in-Mississippi"><a href="#10-People-Arrested-in-Raid-on-Illegal-Gambling-Operation-in-Mississippi" class="headerlink" title="10 People Arrested in Raid on Illegal Gambling Operation in Mississippi"></a>10 People Arrested in Raid on Illegal Gambling Operation in Mississippi</h1><p>On Wednesday, 10 people were taken into custody following a raid on an illegal gambling operation in Mississippi. The suspects, who range in age from 24 to 71, are all charged with Class C gaming crimes.</p>
<p>The raid was conducted by the Harrison County Sheriff’s Office with help from the Gulfport Police Department and the United States Marshals Service. Officers seized several gaming machines, as well as an unknown amount of cash.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that law enforcement has cracked down on illegal gambling operations in Mississippi. In January of this year, 15 people were arrested in a similar raid.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a crime in all 50 states, and can result in both civil and criminal penalties.</p>
<h1 id="Mississippi-Man-Charged-with-Running-Illegal-Gambling-Operation"><a href="#Mississippi-Man-Charged-with-Running-Illegal-Gambling-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Mississippi Man Charged with Running Illegal Gambling Operation"></a>Mississippi Man Charged with Running Illegal Gambling Operation</h1><p>A Mississippi man has been federally charged with running an illegal gambling operation. The man is accused of accepting and paying out bets on sporting events as well as casino games such as blackjack, craps, and roulette.</p>
<p>The gambling operation was allegedly being run out of the man’s home. Federal agents seized bank records, computers, and phones from the home during their investigation.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that this man has been charged with a gambling-related offense. In 2010, he was arrested for running an illegal sports bookmaking business. He plead guilty to that charge and was sentenced to probation.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a crime in all 50 states. It is punishable by fines and/or imprisonment. Gambling operations can also be shut down by law enforcement agencies.</p>
<h1 id="Gamblers-Ravage-Small-Town-as-Police-Struggle-to-Keep-Up-with-Illegal-Gambling-Scene"><a href="#Gamblers-Ravage-Small-Town-as-Police-Struggle-to-Keep-Up-with-Illegal-Gambling-Scene" class="headerlink" title="Gamblers Ravage Small Town as Police Struggle to Keep Up with Illegal Gambling Scene"></a>Gamblers Ravage Small Town as Police Struggle to Keep Up with Illegal Gambling Scene</h1><p>In the small town of Casper, Wyoming, police are struggling to keep up with an illegal gambling scene that has recently taken hold. The town’s population is only about 58,000 people, but gambling officials say that the amount of money being wagered illegally is in the millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The problem for the police department is that they simply don’t have the manpower to crack down on all of the illegal gambling going on. There are only 25 officers in the entire department, and most of them are already stretched thin dealing with other crimes like drug trafficking and violent crime.</p>
<p>As a result, most of the gambling in Casper goes on without any interference from law enforcement. Gambling officials say that there are dozens of illegal casinos and betting parlors in the town, and many of them are operated by organized crime syndicates.</p>
<p>The casinos are typically small operations, run out of people’s homes or basements. But authorities say that they can be extremely dangerous places, often filled with armed criminals. In one recent incident, a man was shot and killed after refusing to hand over his winnings from a casino game.</p>
<p>“These casinos can be very dangerous places,” said Casper Police Chief Chris Walsh. “There are often armed criminals involved, and things can turn violent very quickly.”</p>
<p>Despite the dangers, the casinos continue to thrive due to the large amount of money being wagered. Officials say that much of the money is coming from out-of-state residents who are taking advantage of lax regulation in Wyoming.</p>
<p>“Our state has some of the loosest gambling laws in the country,” said state gambling official Terry Johnson. “This is attracting a lot of criminal activity, and it’s putting our communities at risk.”</p>
<p>Johnson says that he would like to see stricter regulations put in place, but admits that it will be difficult to get such measures approved given the strong opposition from gambling interests. In the meantime, police in Casper will continue to struggle to keep up with an ever-growing illegal gambling scene.</p>
<h1 id="Illegal-Gambling-Operations-on-the-Rise-in-Mississippi"><a href="#Illegal-Gambling-Operations-on-the-Rise-in-Mississippi" class="headerlink" title="Illegal Gambling Operations on the Rise in Mississippi"></a>Illegal Gambling Operations on the Rise in Mississippi</h1><p>In the early hours of Sunday morning, local and state law enforcement officials raided a set of illegal gambling operations in Jackson, Mississippi. This is the latest in a series of such raids that have been conducted in the state in the past few months.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is on the rise in Mississippi, as operators take advantage of the lax regulations and lack of enforcement. This has become a major concern for law enforcement officials, who say that these operations pose a serious threat to public safety.</p>
<p>The recent crackdown on illegal gambling comes as no surprise to many residents of Mississippi, who have long been aware of the proliferation of these operations. In fact, many people have come to see illegal gambling as a normal part of life in the state.</p>
<p>While there have been some efforts by lawmakers to address this issue, more needs to be done to crack down on illegal gambling and protect consumers. The State Legislature should pass measures that would make it easier for law enforcement officials to investigate and shut down these operations.</p>
<p>At the same time, regulators should step up their efforts to enforce existing laws and regulations governing gambling. This will send a clear message that illegal gambling will not be tolerated in Mississippi.</p>

        <h1 id="Cincinnati-Reds-Benefit-From-Sports-Gambling-Ruling"><a href="#Cincinnati-Reds-Benefit-From-Sports-Gambling-Ruling" class="headerlink" title="Cincinnati Reds Benefit From Sports Gambling Ruling"></a>Cincinnati Reds Benefit From Sports Gambling Ruling</h1><p>The Cincinnati Reds baseball organization has found much success in the past decade. The team has consistently contended for a playoff berth and won six division titles. Much of this recent success can be attributed to two major changes in the game of baseball – one being the infusion of fresh young talent into the league, and the other being the legalization of sports gambling.</p>
<p>Sports gambling has long been a part of baseball, with fans betting on everything from games to player performances. However, it was only after the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 2018 that sports gambling became legalized and regulated nationwide. This led to an influx of investment into the industry, as well as a rapid expansion of sports betting options.</p>
<p>What does this mean for baseball? In short, more money is being wagered on games than ever before. This increased action is having a positive impact on teams like the Cincinnati Reds, as more money is being funneled into the sport. Bettors are now more likely to place bets on games featuring competitive teams, which has helped to increase viewership and attendance numbers across the league.</p>
<p>This trend is also benefiting small-market teams like the Reds, who are now able to compete with larger-market teams when it comes to attracting free agents. Players are no longer just looking for lucrative contracts – they’re also looking for cities where they can have a positive impact on the local economy. And with legalized sports gambling providing a financial boost to baseball teams, more players are likely to consider signing with smaller-market clubs.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports gambling has been a boon for baseball, and there’s no indication that this trend will reverse anytime soon. Bettors are now more engaged in games than ever before, and this is resulting in increased profits for teams across the league. So if you’re a fan of the Cincinnati Reds or any other team in MLB, be sure to thank PASPA for all its done to help your favorite club succeed!</p>
<h1 id="Cincinnati-Reds-Gain-Ground-in-Race-for-Division-Crown"><a href="#Cincinnati-Reds-Gain-Ground-in-Race-for-Division-Crown" class="headerlink" title="Cincinnati Reds Gain Ground in Race for Division Crown"></a>Cincinnati Reds Gain Ground in Race for Division Crown</h1><p>The Cincinnati Reds have been on a tear lately, winning seven of their last ten games to move within striking distance of the division-leading Milwaukee Brewers. Their hot streak has been propelled by a resurgent offense that is averaging more than six runs per game over the past week.</p>
<p>Most notably, Joey Votto has heated up at just the right time, hitting .485 with four home runs and 11 RBI in his last ten games. The 2017 MVP candidate has been mired in a slump for most of the season but appears to be finally rounding into form as the Reds make their playoff push.</p>
<p>In addition to Votto, Eugenio Suarez and Scooter Gennett have also been swinging the bat well recently, providing plenty of firepower for Cincinnati. With an offense like that, it’s no wonder they’re making a run at the division crown.</p>
<p>The Brewers still hold a slim lead in the division, but the Reds are definitely making things interesting. If they can keep up this hot streak, they may very well end up winning the division and advancing to the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="MLB-Cincinnati-Reds-Benefited-From-Sports-Gambling-Ruling"><a href="#MLB-Cincinnati-Reds-Benefited-From-Sports-Gambling-Ruling" class="headerlink" title="MLB: Cincinnati Reds Benefited From Sports Gambling Ruling"></a>MLB: Cincinnati Reds Benefited From Sports Gambling Ruling</h1><p>The Cincinnati Reds benefited from the Supreme Court’s ruling on sports gambling, as they were one of the teams who were able to get a piece of the $108 million that was wagered on their game against the Chicago Cubs. This money was split up between the team and Major League Baseball, with each receiving roughly $3.8 million. This is a new business opportunity for teams, as they can now get a piece of the action by having their own sportsbook or working with an existing sportsbook.</p>
<p>It is unclear at this point how much money teams will be able to make from this ruling, but it is safe to say that it will be a significant amount. Teams have been looking for new sources of revenue in recent years, as ticket sales and TV ratings have declined. This has led to some teams being sold for significantly less than what they are worth, as the new owners are looking to make money through other means.</p>
<p>Sports gambling could be a major boon for these teams, as it is a billion-dollar industry. There are already millions of people who bet on sports each year, and this number is only going to increase now that gambling is legal in more states. Teams can capitalize on this by setting up their own sportsbooks or by partnering with an existing sportsbook.</p>
<p>This ruling is also good news for fans, as they now have more ways to bet on games. This means that they can root for their team with even more intensity, as they can make some money while doing so. It will also be interesting to see how teams adjust their lines in response to gambling becoming more prevalent.</p>
<h1 id="Betting-on-Baseball-Cincinnati-Reds-Reap-Rewards-of-Sports-Gambling-Ruling"><a href="#Betting-on-Baseball-Cincinnati-Reds-Reap-Rewards-of-Sports-Gambling-Ruling" class="headerlink" title="Betting on Baseball: Cincinnati Reds Reap Rewards of Sports Gambling Ruling"></a>Betting on Baseball: Cincinnati Reds Reap Rewards of Sports Gambling Ruling</h1><p>A Supreme Court ruling in May legalized sports gambling nationwide, and while some are worried about the potential for corruption, others see it as an opportunity to make money. The Cincinnati Reds are among the teams taking advantage of the new ruling, and they are winning big.</p>
<p>Sports gambling is nothing new, of course. Fans have been betting on games for centuries. But the legality of sports gambling has always been a bit murky. In 1992, Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which essentially made sports gambling illegal everywhere except Nevada. PASPA was challenged in court, and in May 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The immediate effects of the ruling were clear. The stock prices for casino operators increased significantly, as did the share prices for companies that provide fantasy sports games. But what about the teams themselves? How would they be affected by the legalization of sports gambling?</p>
<p>It turns out that most teams aren’t really sure what to make of it all. Some have embraced it, while others have been more cautious. But one team that has taken advantage of the ruling is the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
<p>The Reds are a small-market team that doesn’t have much money to spend on players. So they have had to find creative ways to compete with teams like the Yankees and Dodgers. One of those ways is by embracing sports gambling.</p>
<p>The Reds were one of the first teams to sign a deal with a sports betting site called PointsBet. Under this deal, PointsBet will become an official betting partner of the Reds, and fans will be able to bet on games through their app or website. And it’s not just a marketing gimmick – PointsBet is actually giving money back to fans who bet on Reds games.</p>
<p>For example, if you bet $10 on the Reds and they win, you would get $11 back (assuming you placed a winning bet). This type of rebate is known as “risk-free bets”, and PointsBet is offering them on all Reds games this season.</p>
<p>So why are the Reds doing this? Are they desperate for money? Not at all – in fact, they’re actually making quite a bit of money from this deal. They view it as a way to get more fans engaged in their team, and they figure that some fans will eventually start betting on other games as well (not just Reds games). And if those fans happen to lose money betting on other games, well that’s OK too – as long as they keep coming back to support their favorite team.</p>
<p>Other teams are starting to take notice of what the Reds are doing, and many are considering similar deals with sports betting sites. So far only a handful of teams have done deals like this, but expect that number to grow in the years ahead.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-Cincinnati-Reds-Won-by-Benefiting-from-the-Sports-Gambling-Ruling"><a href="#How-the-Cincinnati-Reds-Won-by-Benefiting-from-the-Sports-Gambling-Ruling" class="headerlink" title="How the Cincinnati Reds Won by Benefiting from the Sports Gambling Ruling"></a>How the Cincinnati Reds Won by Benefiting from the Sports Gambling Ruling</h1><p>Earlier this year, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey in its efforts to legalize sports gambling. The 6-3 ruling struck down a 1992 federal law that banned sports betting in most states. This has led to many states, including Pennsylvania and West Virginia, moving to legalize sports gambling in the hopes of cashing in on the $150 billion global market.</p>
<p>The ruling was a big victory for the casino industry, as well as for state governments that see gambling as a potential source of revenue. But it was also a victory for the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
<p>The Reds had been struggling in recent years, finishing last in their division three of the past four seasons. But with the legalization of sports gambling, they have been one of the league’s hottest teams. In fact, they currently lead their division and are favorites to make the playoffs for the first time since 2013.</p>
<p>How has legalized sports gambling helped the Reds? First and foremost, it has given them a new source of revenue. The team now has an official betting partner, William Hill US, which is paying them an annual sponsorship fee and gives them a cut of all bets placed on Reds games.</p>
<p>The team has also seen a boost in attendance. Attendance at Reds games is up 5% this year compared to last year, with many fans coming to watch not just baseball but also betting odds and point spreads.</p>
<p>Legalized sports gambling has also led to more engaged fans. In addition to watching games and placing bets, fans are now following teams more closely and analyzing matchups more closely in order to make better bets. This has led to increased interest in baseball – and especially in the Cincinnati Reds – among fans who might not have otherwise paid attention.</p>
<p>So while some may see legalized sports gambling as a negative development, it has been a positive for the Cincinnati Reds. It has given them a new source of revenue, boosted attendance, and engaged fans more closely with the sport of baseball. As long as they continue to play well, there is no doubt that legalized sports gambling will benefit the team</p>

        <h1 id="When-Was-Sports-Gambling-Legalized-In-Nevada"><a href="#When-Was-Sports-Gambling-Legalized-In-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="When Was Sports Gambling Legalized In Nevada?"></a>When Was Sports Gambling Legalized In Nevada?</h1><p>Sports gambling has been around in some form or another for centuries, but it was not always legal. Nevada was the first state to legalize sports gambling in 1949. This was largely due to the influence of Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel, a mobster who played a major role in the development of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Siegel was one of the original investors in the Flamingo Hotel and Casino, which became the first casino on the Las Vegas Strip. He also helped organize illegal gambling operations in the city. In 1947, Siegel was killed by rival mobsters, but his legacy lives on in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports gambling in Nevada can be traced back to a bill that was introduced in the state legislature in 1947. The bill did not pass at the time, but it was reintroduced a year later and passed by a vote of 21-1. The Nevada Gaming Control Board (NCGB) was created as a result of this legislation, and it is responsible for regulating all forms of gaming in the state.</p>
<p>One reason why Nevada was able to legalize sports gambling so quickly was because it already had a well-established gaming industry. This included casinos, poker rooms, and horse racing tracks. In addition, there were already many people living in Nevada who were familiar with betting on sports.</p>
<p>There was some opposition to legalizing sports gambling in Nevada, but it ultimately prevailed. One concern was that it would lead to increased crime rates, but there is no evidence that this is true. Another concern was that it would be detrimental to the state’s tourism industry, but again there is no evidence to support this claim.</p>
<p>Legalizing sports gambling has been a boon for the Nevada economy. In fact, according to a study conducted by UNLV professor Dr. David Schwartz, almost half of all casino revenue in Nevada comes from sports betting activities. This amounts to more than $2 billion per year!</p>
<p>So why did Nevada become the first state to legalize sports gambling? There are several reasons: it had a well-established gaming industry, there were already many people living in Nevada who were familiar with betting on sports, and lawmakers saw it as an opportunity to generate revenue for the state economy.</p>
<h1 id="The-Answer-To-This-Question-May-Surprise-You"><a href="#The-Answer-To-This-Question-May-Surprise-You" class="headerlink" title="The Answer To This Question May Surprise You!"></a>The Answer To This Question May Surprise You!</h1><p>When it comes to improving the appearance of our skin, many of us think that the key to achieving this goal is through expensive creams and treatments. However, what if we told you that the answer is actually quite simple? In fact, it can be summed up in three words: sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen!</p>
<p>Believe it or not, wearing sunscreen every day is one of the best things that you can do for your skin. This is because sunscreen protects your skin from harmful UV rays, which can cause a variety of skin problems including sunburns, wrinkles, and even skin cancer.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for healthy and beautiful skin, make sure to lather on the sunscreen each and every day!</p>
<h1 id="How-Nevada-Became-The-Gambling-Capital-Of-The-World"><a href="#How-Nevada-Became-The-Gambling-Capital-Of-The-World" class="headerlink" title="How Nevada Became The Gambling Capital Of The World"></a>How Nevada Became The Gambling Capital Of The World</h1><p>The history of gambling in Nevada is a long and colorful one, dating back to before the state even became a part of the United States. In fact, it could be argued that gambling is in Nevada’s DNA, and that the state’s lax attitude towards the practice has helped make it the gambling capital of the world.</p>
<p>The origins of gambling in Nevada can be traced all the way back to 1829, when trappers and traders started coming through the area and playing games of chance for money. These early gambles were often conducted in secret, as gambling was illegal at the time. But that didn’t stop people from indulging in their favorite pastime, and over time, Nevada developed a reputation as a place where you could find any type of game you wanted.</p>
<p>In 1871, Nevada became a state, and while gambling remained illegal, there was no longer any danger of prosecution. This led to a surge in popularity for gambling establishments, which started popping up all over the state. By 1909, there were more than 100 legitimate casinos operating in Nevada.</p>
<p>The early days of casino gambling were wild and lawless times, with brothels and gunfights commonplace. But as time went on, regulation gradually began to creep into the industry. In 1931, Nevada became the first state to legalize casino gambling (although it was still prohibited in Las Vegas), and over time restrictions on games like bingo and slots were lifted.</p>
<p>Today, Nevada is synonymous with gambling, thanks in large part to Las Vegas. The city has been dubbed “the Sin City” for its many casinos and resorts, which offer every type of game imaginable. And while other states have begun to legalize casino gambling in recent years, Nevada still remains king when it comes to gambling revenue.</p>
<p>So what is it about Nevada that makes it so hospitable to gamblers? Well, for starters, there’s no sales tax on casino winnings (unlike some other states), which gives players an incentive to gamble. And then there’s the fact thatNevada has always had a laissez-faire approach towards gaming regulation – something that has drawn gamblers from all over the world.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, there’s no doubt that Nevada is the top destination for gamblers looking for a good time. Whether you’re looking for blackjack or craps, poker or roulette, you can find it all in Las Vegas and elsewhere in Nevada. So if you want to experience everything that the world of gambling has to offer, then head on over to The Silver State – you won’t be disappointed!</p>
<h1 id="What-Led-To-The-legalization-Of-Sports-Gambling-In-Nevada"><a href="#What-Led-To-The-legalization-Of-Sports-Gambling-In-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="What Led To The legalization Of Sports Gambling In Nevada?"></a>What Led To The legalization Of Sports Gambling In Nevada?</h1><p>The legalization of sports gambling in Nevada can be traced back to a 1991 decision by the United States Supreme Court. In that case, the Court ruled that the state of New Jersey could not prohibit sports betting at its racetracks.</p>
<p>The key issue in the case was whether or not the federal ban on sports betting, known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), was constitutional. The Court ruled that it was not, concluding that the federal government could not prevent states from enacting their own laws on the matter.</p>
<p>While the decision did not legalize sports gambling nationwide, it opened the door for other states to do so if they chose to. And that is precisely what happened in Nevada, which became the first state to fully legalize sports betting in 2013.</p>
<p>So why did the Supreme Court rule in favor of New Jersey? There were actually two issues at play.</p>
<p>First, the Court determined that PASPA violated state sovereignty by preventing states from making their own decisions on this issue. Second, the Court found that PASPA interfered with Congress’s authority to regulate interstate commerce.</p>
<p>In short, the Court felt that PASPA went too far in interfering with state autonomy and congressional power. This ruling paved the way for other states to legalize sports gambling if they choose to do so.</p>
<h1 id="A-Look-Back-At-Nevada’s-Controversial-Decision-To-Legalize-Sports-Gambling"><a href="#A-Look-Back-At-Nevada’s-Controversial-Decision-To-Legalize-Sports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="A Look Back At Nevada’s Controversial Decision To Legalize Sports Gambling"></a>A Look Back At Nevada’s Controversial Decision To Legalize Sports Gambling</h1><p>On May 14, 2018, the Nevada Gaming Commission approved regulations permitting sports betting in the state. The decision came after the US Supreme Court lifted a ban on such gambling in all states outside of Nevada.</p>
<p>The reaction to Nevada’s legalization of sports gambling was mixed. Some proponents argued that the move would bring much-needed revenue to the state, while others raised concerns about the potential for increased addiction and corruption.</p>
<p>In the months since the decision was made, several other states have followed suit, legalizing sports betting within their borders. This has led to much debate over the benefits and drawbacks of legalized sports gambling.</p>
<p>Supporters of sports betting argue that it is a harmless way to enjoy some entertainment and potentially make some money. They say that it can be safely regulated and that it will help generate revenue for states and municipalities.</p>
<p>Critics of sports betting contend that it can lead to addiction and financial ruin for many people. They also warn about the potential for corruption in light of recent scandals in professional sports.</p>
<p>So far, there has been little evidence to support either side of this argument. It remains to be seen how Nevada’s decision to legalize sports gambling will play out in the long run.</p>

The legality of slot machines is determined by the individual state laws.</p>
<p>New York is one of the states where slot machines are currently illegal. However, there have been recent discussions about legalizing slot machines in New York. There is no set timeline for when this will happen, but it is possible that slot machines will be legalized in New York in the near future.</p>
<p>If you want to gamble on slot machines, you can do so in states where they are legal. If you are interested in playing slot machines, you should research the laws of the state where you plan to gamble. Be sure to know what is allowed and what is not allowed before you start playing.</p>
<h1 id="When-Will-Horse-Racing-Be-Legal-In-Ny"><a href="#When-Will-Horse-Racing-Be-Legal-In-Ny" class="headerlink" title="When Will Horse Racing Be Legal In Ny?"></a>When Will Horse Racing Be Legal In Ny?</h1><p>It’s been more than two years since horse racing enthusiast and governor Andrew Cuomo announced his plan to legalize the sport in New York.</p>
<p>Cuomo’s initial proposal would have allowed up to seven racetracks in the state, but there has been little movement on the issue since then.</p>
<p>There are a few potential roadblocks to legalization. First, New York state legislators would have to approve any race track licenses. Second, some labor unions representing casino workers are opposed to introducing new competition for their members.</p>
<p>And finally, there is the question of how much money the state would make from taxing horse racing. Cuomo initially proposed a 10% tax on bets, but the legislature may want a higher percentage.</p>
<p>Supporters of horse racing argue that it would be a major boon to the economy, creating jobs and generating tax revenue. They also say that it would be a safe and humane way to bet on horses.</p>
<p>Opponents of horse racing argue that it is cruel to force horses to run in races and that it is dangerous for both horses and humans. They also argue that legalization would lead to an increase in problem gambling.</p>
<h1 id="When-Will-Lottery-Be-Legal-In-Ny"><a href="#When-Will-Lottery-Be-Legal-In-Ny" class="headerlink" title="When Will Lottery Be Legal In Ny?"></a>When Will Lottery Be Legal In Ny?</h1><p>Although playing the lottery is not currently legal in New York, there are many who believe that it will eventually become legalized. This is due, in part, to the potential tax revenue that could be generated from gambling and the billions of dollars that are spent on lotteries each year in other states.</p>
<p>There are currently several bills pending in the state legislature that would make playing the lottery legal in New York. One of these bills, known as the New York Lottery Gaming Act, was introduced by Assemblyman Gary Pretlow in early 2017. The act would allow for the establishment of a state-run lottery, as well as the sale of tickets through authorized retailers.</p>
<p>If the act were to be passed, it would likely go into effect on January 1, 2019. This would give New York residents plenty of time to prepare for what is likely to be a very popular lottery game. In fact, it is estimated that more than 60% of New Yorkers would purchase tickets if the state-run lottery were to become available.</p>
<p>There are some who oppose legalizing the lottery in New York, however. These opponents argue that lotteries are nothing more than a form of gambling and that they can lead to addiction and financial ruin. They also maintain that the proceeds from lotteries should be used to fund education and other important government programs instead of being used for gambling purposes.</p>
<p>Despite the opposition, it seems likely that the legalization of the lottery will eventually happen in New York. This is due, in part, to the fact that other states have seen significant benefits from legalizing this type of gaming activity. For example, Massachusetts has seen an increase in revenue since they began selling tickets for their state-run lottery in September 2015.</p>
<h1 id="When-Will-Gambling-Be-Legal-In-Ny"><a href="#When-Will-Gambling-Be-Legal-In-Ny" class="headerlink" title="When Will Gambling Be Legal In Ny?"></a>When Will Gambling Be Legal In Ny?</h1><p>On June 13, 2019, the New York State Assembly passed a bill to legalize gambling in the state. The bill has yet to be voted on by the Senate, but if it is approved, New Yorkers could soon be able to gamble atracinos, sports betting, and other casino games.</p>
<p>So when will gambling actually be legal in NY? It’s difficult to say for certain, as the Senate still needs to vote on the bill and there may be some changes made before it is finally approved. However, we can make some predictions based on what we know about the current legislation.</p>
<p>If the Senate passes the bill as it is currently written, then it would go into effect thirty days after being signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo. This means that gambling could potentially be legal in NY by the end of July 2019.</p>
<p>However, there is always a chance that the Senate will make amendments to the bill or that Governor Cuomo will veto it. If that happens, then it’s possible that gambling won’t be legalized in NY until early 2020.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for New Yorkers? Well, if gambling is legalized, you’ll be able to visit a racino, place a sports bet, or play at a casino near you. There may also be online options available for those who prefer to gamble from home.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some who oppose gambling legalization and feel that it could lead to increased crime rates and addiction problems. But proponents argue that legalizing gambling will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the state.</p>
<p>Only time will tell which side of the argument wins out. In the meantime, New Yorkers can keep an eye on the news and wait to see if they’ll soon be able to gamble legally in their state.</p>
<h1 id="When-Will-Online-Gambling-Be-Legal-In-Ny"><a href="#When-Will-Online-Gambling-Be-Legal-In-Ny" class="headerlink" title="When Will Online Gambling Be Legal In Ny?"></a>When Will Online Gambling Be Legal In Ny?</h1><p>The legalization of online gambling in New York is a hot topic among lawmakers and casino operators in the state. There are many opinions on when, or if, it will ever be legalized.</p>
<p>Some people feel that online gambling will never be legalized in New York because there is too much opposition from religious groups and other conservative organizations. Others believe that legalization is only a matter of time, as states around the country are moving towards regulating and taxing online gambling.</p>
<p>A recent study by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) estimated that legalizing online poker in New York could bring in as much as $186 million in new revenue each year. This number is based on estimates that between 2.5 and 3 million New Yorkers would participate in online poker if it were made legal.</p>
<p>There are several proposals being considered by lawmakers to legalize online gambling in New York. One bill, introduced by Assemblyman Gary Pretlow earlier this year, would create a licensing program for online poker operators and allow them to offer their games to residents of the state.</p>
<p>Another proposal, introduced by Senator John Bonacic in 2015, would establish a framework for regulating all forms of online gambling in New York. This bill would allow for both land-based casinos and Indian tribes to offer online gambling services to residents of the state.</p>
<p>There is no definitive answer on when or if online gambling will be legalized in New York, but the prospects look promising considering the potential revenue it could generate for the state.</p>

        <h1 id="Tips-to-Winning-at-Home-Gambling"><a href="#Tips-to-Winning-at-Home-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Winning at Home Gambling"></a>Tips to Winning at Home Gambling</h1><p>There are a lot of people that gamble whether it is at a casino or online. The excitement of potentially winning big money is a feeling that many people cannot resist. However, many people do not realize that there are techniques that can be implemented in order to increase the chances of winning when gambling at home. </p>
<p>The following tips should help those who want to increase their chances of winning when gambling: </p>
<p>Tip 1: Have A Specific Goal In Mind<br>When gambling, it is important to have a specific goal in mind. This could be something like cashing out with a certain amount of money or simply breaking even. This will help to keep focus while gambling and will help to avoid any losses from becoming too costly. </p>
<p>Tip 2: Only Gamble What You Can Afford To Lose<br>When gambling, it is important to only gamble what you can afford to lose. This will help to ensure that any losses sustained will not have a negative impact on your finances. It is also important to set win and loss limits in order to prevent oneself from losing too much money while gambling. </p>
<p>Tip 3: Do Not Get Emotional About Gambling<br>When gambling, it is important not to get emotional about the outcome of the game. This means avoiding placing bets based on gut feelings or intuition as these can often lead to poor decision-making. Instead, try and stay calm and rational when making bets in order to improve the chances of making wise choices. </p>
<p>Tip 4: Spread Your Bets Across Multiple Games<br>When gambling, it is often advisable to spread one’s bets across multiple games rather than placing all of one’s eggs into one basket. This will help ensure that if one game does not go as planned, there are still other games with which the person can make a profit.<br>Gambling at home can be enjoyable and profitable if the right techniques are implemented. By following the tips above, individuals can greatly improve their chances of winning when gambling at home</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Make-the-Most-of-Online-Casino-Gaming"><a href="#How-to-Make-the-Most-of-Online-Casino-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="How to Make the Most of Online Casino Gaming"></a>How to Make the Most of Online Casino Gaming</h1><p>In a day and age where technology reigns supreme, more and more people are turning to the internet for entertainment. This is especially true when it comes to casino gaming, as online casinos offer players an experience that’s unparalleled by traditional brick-and-mortar establishments.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to get the most out of your online casino gaming, make sure to keep the following tips in mind: </p>
<p>Choose the Right Casino<br>The first step in getting the most out of online casino gaming is choosing the right casino. Not all online casinos are created equal – some offer better bonuses, games and overall experiences than others. Do your research and choose a casino that meets your needs and expectations.</p>
<p>Create a Strategy<br>Just like in any other form of gambling, having a strategy is key to success when playing at online casinos. Before you start playing any games, come up with a plan on how you’re going to play. This will help increase your chances of winning while minimizing your losses.</p>
<p>Don’t Gamble More Than You Can Afford to Lose<br>One of the biggest mistakes that new gamblers make is betting more money than they can afford to lose. Remember – gambling should always be considered a form of entertainment, not an investment. So don’t put yourself in financial jeopardy simply for the thrill of gambling.</p>
<p>Take Advantage of Bonuses and Promotions<br>One of the best things about playing at online casinos is that many of them offer lucrative bonuses and promotions. Make sure to take advantage of these offers as they can give you a significant edge over the competition. Just be sure to read the terms and conditions associated with each bonus before accepting it, as there may be certain wagering requirements or other restrictions attached.</p>
<p>Study Up on Casino Games<br>In order to make the most out of your casino gaming experience, it’s important to know what you’re doing. This means studying up on different casino games so you can understand the basics before jumping in head first. There are plenty of resources available online (including this one), so there’s no excuse not to learn at least the basics of each game before playing for real money.</p>
<h1 id="Working-from-Home-with-your-Own-Casino-Games"><a href="#Working-from-Home-with-your-Own-Casino-Games" class="headerlink" title="Working from Home with your Own Casino Games"></a>Working from Home with your Own Casino Games</h1><p>Do you love playing casino games? Do you wish you could play them all day long from the comfort of your own home? If so, you’re in luck! There are now several online casinos that allow you to play their games for free – or for real money – from the comfort of your own living room.</p>
<p>Before you start playing, however, it’s important to know a few things about online casinos. The first is that not all casinos are created equal. Some are reputable and trustworthy, while others are not. So, it’s important to do your research before choosing an online casino to play at.</p>
<p>The second thing to know is that most casinos offer both free and real money games. If you’re just starting out, it might be a good idea to play some of the free games first to get a feel for how the casino works and the types of games that are available.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found a reputable casino that offers the type of games you want to play, it’s time to start playing for real money! Most casinos will offer a variety of bonuses and promotions, so be sure to take advantage of them. These can include sign-up bonuses, match bonuses, loyalty programs, and more.</p>
<p>In addition, many casinos also offer tournaments. These can be a lot of fun, especially if you enjoy competing against others. Just be sure to read the terms and conditions before signing up; some tournaments have high entry fees and/or require a large bankroll.</p>
<p>Finally, remember to always gamble responsibly. Never spend more than you can afford to lose, and be sure to have fun!</p>
<h1 id="Playing-Casino-Games-from-Your-Own-Home-Office"><a href="#Playing-Casino-Games-from-Your-Own-Home-Office" class="headerlink" title="Playing Casino Games from Your Own Home Office"></a>Playing Casino Games from Your Own Home Office</h1><p>There are a lot of people out there who love to gamble. There is something about the thrill of putting money on the line and seeing if you can come out on top that just draws people in. Unfortunately, for a lot of people, travelling to a casino can be prohibitive. The cost of travel, finding a babysitter, and getting time off work can all add up and keep people from enjoying this pastime.</p>
<p>Luckily for these people, there are now ways to play casino games from the comfort of your own home office. Websites like Slotomania offer a wide variety of games that you can play for free or for real money. You can also choose to play on your phone or computer, making it easy to fit gambling into your busy schedule.</p>
<p>Playing casino games from home also has other benefits. For starters, you can avoid the crowds at the casino and focus on your game without being distracted. You can also take advantage of bonuses and other promotions that are available only to online players. Finally, playing at home means that you can keep all of your winnings!</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a new way to enjoy some down time, consider giving online casinos a try!</p>
<h1 id="Benefits-of-Online-Casino-Gaming-from-the-Comfort-of-Your-Home"><a href="#Benefits-of-Online-Casino-Gaming-from-the-Comfort-of-Your-Home" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of Online Casino Gaming from the Comfort of Your Home"></a>Benefits of Online Casino Gaming from the Comfort of Your Home</h1><p>Online casino gaming is one of the most popular online activities that people engage in. The top reasons for this are that it is convenient, comfortable and can provide great rewards. Here are some of the benefits of online casino gaming from the comfort of your home:</p>
<p> Convenience: One of the biggest benefits of online casino gaming is that it is incredibly convenient. This is because you can access it from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. You don’t have to leave your home or travel to a physical casino location, which can save you time and money.</p>
<p>Comfort: Another big benefit of online casino gaming is that it is comfortable. This is because you can play in your own home without having to dress up or worry about the noise level at a physical casino. You can also take breaks whenever you want and there is no pressure to keep playing if you don’t want to.</p>
<p>Rewards: One of the best things about online casino gaming is that there are often great rewards available. This includes both sign-up bonuses and ongoing rewards for players who stick around. This means that you can potentially earn more money by playing online than you would at a physical casino.</p>

        <h1 id="Casino-Closes-its-Doors-after-Investigation-Reveals-Fraudulent-Activities"><a href="#Casino-Closes-its-Doors-after-Investigation-Reveals-Fraudulent-Activities" class="headerlink" title="Casino Closes its Doors after Investigation Reveals Fraudulent Activities"></a>Casino Closes its Doors after Investigation Reveals Fraudulent Activities</h1><p>The popular casino, which has been in business for over two decades, has abruptly closed its doors after an investigation revealed that its staff had been engaging in fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>According to the casino’s management, some of its employees had been colluding with players in order to ensure that they would win large sums of money. In some cases, employees had even been helping players to cheat the casino’s systems.</p>
<p>The closure of the casino has come as a major shock to its customers, who were not expecting such a turn of events. Many of them are now wondering what they are going to do with all the money they had stashed away in their accounts.</p>
<p>While the casino is not giving any reasons for its closure, it is believed that the authorities may have had a hand in it. It is possible that they were investigating the casino and its staff for some time before finally taking action.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a casino has been forced to close down due to fraudulent activities. In fact, it is becoming increasingly common for casinos to be targeted by scam artists. As a result, players need to be extra careful when deciding where to place their bets.</p>
<p>There are still plenty of honest casinos out there that offer fair games and pay out genuine winnings. So if you’re looking for a safe and reliable gambling experience, be sure to do your research before choosing one.</p>
<h1 id="300-Employees-Lay-off-After-Santa-Claran-Casino-Closes"><a href="#300-Employees-Lay-off-After-Santa-Claran-Casino-Closes" class="headerlink" title="300 Employees Lay off After Santa Claran Casino Closes"></a>300 Employees Lay off After Santa Claran Casino Closes</h1><p>The Santa Claran Casino was a mainstay in the town of Española for nearly 50 years. But on Wednesday, Oct. 17, it closed its doors for good, leaving 300 employees out of work.</p>
<p>Some of those employees had worked at the casino since it opened in 1969.</p>
<p>“It’s a hard pill to swallow,” said Jesse Montoya, who had been employed as a cook at the casino for 25 years. “I don’t know what I’m going to do now.”</p>
<p>The casino closure is the latest blow to Española, which has seen a number of businesses close in recent years. In addition to the layoffs, the closure will also have a ripple effect on the town’s economy, as employees spend their money at local businesses.</p>
<p>Owner Ray Martinez said the decision to close the casino was difficult but necessary.</p>
<p>“The writing was on the wall,” Martinez said. “We just couldn’t make it work anymore.” </p>
<p> Martinez blamed changing demographics and increased regulation for the closure. The latter has made it more difficult for casinos to operate profitably.</p>
<p>In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Gov. Susana Martinez said she was saddened by the news of the casino closure but thanked the workers for their years of service.</p>
<p>The Santa Claran Casino is one of five Native American casinos in New Mexico that have closed in recent years.</p>
<h1 id="5-Million-in-Fake-Chips-Discovered-at-Santa-Claran-Casino"><a href="#5-Million-in-Fake-Chips-Discovered-at-Santa-Claran-Casino" class="headerlink" title="$5 Million in Fake Chips Discovered at Santa Claran Casino"></a>$5 Million in Fake Chips Discovered at Santa Claran Casino</h1><p>On Sunday, the Santa Claran Casino in Española, New Mexico announced that it had discovered nearly $5 million worth of counterfeit casino chips. According to officials at the casino, the chips were found during a routine inventory check and were apparently printed in China.</p>
<p>The discovery of the fake chips is a major blow to the Santa Claran Casino, which has been struggling in recent years to compete with neighboring casinos in Taos and Raton. In a statement released on Sunday, casino officials said that they were working with local law enforcement to investigate the matter and planned to prosecute those responsible for producing the counterfeit chips.</p>
<p>“This is a major crime,” said casino spokesman Tony Congiardo in a statement to reporters. “We will not tolerate this type of behavior from anyone, and we are working aggressively with law enforcement to identify and prosecute those responsible.”</p>
<p>News of the discovery of the fake chips comes just weeks after officials at the Santa Claran Casino announced plans to close its doors later this year. The closure of the casino would leave Española without any gambling facilities, a major blow to the local economy.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Empire-Falls-as-Santa-Claran-Casino-Closes-Its-Doors"><a href="#Gambling-Empire-Falls-as-Santa-Claran-Casino-Closes-Its-Doors" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Empire Falls as Santa Claran Casino Closes Its Doors"></a>Gambling Empire Falls as Santa Claran Casino Closes Its Doors</h1><p>SANTA CLARA, CA - The Santa Claran Casino, once a shining jewel in the gambling empire of Nevada and a popular tourist destination for Bay Area residents, announced today that it will be closing its doors for good.</p>
<p>The closure comes as a surprise to many, as the casino had been doing well in recent months, thanks in part to the legalization of online poker in California. But an industry insider who declined to be identified said that the casino’s owner, Wooldridge Gaming LLC, may have overextended itself by taking on too much debt.</p>
<p>In a statement released to the media, Wooldridge Gaming LLC said that it was “saddened” to announce the closure but that it had no other choice. “We would like to thank our employees, customers and partners for their support over the years,” the statement read. “We hope that you will visit our other properties in the future.”</p>
<p>The closure is expected to have a ripple effect throughout the local economy, as the casino employed more than 700 people. The Santa Clara Convention and Visitors Bureau estimates that the casino generated $100 million annually for the local economy.</p>
<p>Word of the casino’s closure spread quickly on social media, with many people expressing their sadness at losing what had become an important part of their community. “This is so sad,” wrote one resident on Twitter. “My husband and I loved spending time at Santa Claran Casino.”</p>
<h1 id="Statewide-Manhunt-for-Crooked-Casino-Owner-Who-Cheated-Employees-and-Gamblers-Out-of-Millions"><a href="#Statewide-Manhunt-for-Crooked-Casino-Owner-Who-Cheated-Employees-and-Gamblers-Out-of-Millions" class="headerlink" title="Statewide Manhunt for Crooked Casino Owner Who Cheated Employees and Gamblers Out of Millions"></a>Statewide Manhunt for Crooked Casino Owner Who Cheated Employees and Gamblers Out of Millions</h1><p>Las Vegas, NV - Tuesday morning a statewide manhunt was issued for casino owner Christopher P. Matthews who is wanted for cheating employees and gamblers out of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department began investigating Matthews in July after several employees came forward with evidence that he had been skimming money from the casino’s profits. Investigators also discovered that Matthews had been rigging slot machines to payout more often than they should have, resulting in thousands of dollars in losses for unwitting gamblers.</p>
<p>Matthews was able to get away with his scheme for years due to his close relationships with several high-ranking police officers in the department. However, after his crimes were exposed, Matthews quickly fled the state and has been on the run ever since.</p>
<p>Authorities are asking for the public’s help in locating Matthews, who is believed to be hiding out somewhere in Nevada or California. He is considered to be armed and dangerous, so anyone who sees him should not attempt to apprehend him themselves.</p>
<p>Please contact the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department at 702-828-3111 if you have any information on Christopher P. Matthews’ whereabouts.</p>

<p>Of all the casinos in the world, none is as legendary as Rocky Space Casino. This casino is located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is known for its high stakes and loose atmosphere. If you’re looking to make some serious money, Rocky Space Casino is the place to be.</p>
<p>But before you head out there, it’s important to know what it takes to beat the house. Here are a few tips:</p>
<p>#1 – Know Your Odds</p>
<p>The first step to beating the house is understanding the odds. In general, casino games are designed so that the house has an edge of around 2-3%. This means that for every $100 you bet, you can expect to lose around $2-3 in the long run.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this disadvantage, you need to know when to walk away from the table. If you’re down $200 and you’ve only been playing for an hour, it’s time to cut your losses and move on. Remember: gambling should be fun, not stressful!</p>
<p>#2 – Play Smart<br>CASINO GAMES ARE DESIGNED TO BE ADDICTIVE. THIS IS WHY THE HOUSE HAS AN EDGE OVER THE PLAYER. BUT IF YOU PLAY SMART AND ONLY BET WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE, THEN YOU STAND A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF WINNING IN THE LONG RUN.</p>
<p>#3 – Know The Games<br>Not all casino games are created equal. Some games offer better odds than others, so it’s important to know which games give you the best chance of winning. Blackjack and craps, for example, offer better odds than baccarat or roulette. So if you’re looking to make some money, these are two games worth playing.</p>
<p>#4 – Don’t Chase Losses<br>One of the biggest mistakes novice gamblers make is chasing their losses. If you lose your first $100 playing blackjack, for example, don’t try and win it back by betting your remaining $200 on the next hand! This is a recipe for disaster and will only lead to bigger losses in the long run.</p>

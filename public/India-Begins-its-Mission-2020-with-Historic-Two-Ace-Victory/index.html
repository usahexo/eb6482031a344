The launches of the Microsat-R and the Kalamsat-V2 satellites on January 24 represent notable milestones in India’s ambitious space programme, Mission 2020.</p>
<p>The Microsat-R satellite is a key reconnaissance and surveillance asset, while the Kalamsat-V2 is the world’s smallest communication satellite. Both satellites were placed into orbit by a PSLV launcher from Sriharikota spaceport in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>These launches are a major step forward for India as it strives to achieve its goal of becoming a leading space power by 2020. ISRO has been making rapid strides in recent years, with an increasing number of successful launches and technological achievements.</p>
<p>The organisation has also been expanding its collaborative ties with other countries, most notably Japan and France. In March last year, ISRO and JAXA jointly launched the Microsat-R satellite, marking the first time an Indian satellite had been launched by a Japanese rocket.</p>
<p>In September 2018, ISRO also joined forces with CNES, the French space agency, to launch two experimental suborbital satellites aboard a French rocket. This marked another important milestone in India’s growing partnership with France in the field of space exploration.</p>
<p>With these latest achievements, India is well on its way to realising its ambitious space goals. The country’s rapidly expanding space programme is helping to boost its economy and establish it as a major player on the global stage.</p>
<h1 id="India-Aces-Second-Test-Match-and-Gains-Momentum-in-their-Quest-for-2020-ICC-World-Cup-Glory"><a href="#India-Aces-Second-Test-Match-and-Gains-Momentum-in-their-Quest-for-2020-ICC-World-Cup-Glory" class="headerlink" title="India Aces Second Test Match and Gains Momentum in their Quest for 2020 ICC World Cup Glory"></a>India Aces Second Test Match and Gains Momentum in their Quest for 2020 ICC World Cup Glory</h1><p>In a thrilling Test match which went down to the wire, Team India scripted a memorable victory over the Proteas at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore on Tuesday to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. After being put in to bat, Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane played patiently to put up a 137-run partnership for the second wicket. Kohli was dismissed for 79, but Rahane (101*) carried on to score his first Test century in India and help his team post a total of 335. In reply, South Africa were bowled out for 307, with Ravichandran Ashwin picking up six wickets.</p>
<p>In the second innings, India collapsed from 131/2 to 209 all out, setting South Africa a target of 176 runs to win. The Proteas started off well but lost wickets at regular intervals and eventually fell short by 31 runs. With this win, India have gained momentum in their quest for 2020 ICC World Cup glory.</p>
<p>Here are five factors that contributed to Team India’s victory:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Captain Virat Kohli’s batting: After being criticized for his slow batting in the first innings of the match against England at Edgbaston last month, Kohli came back strongly in Bangalore with an innings of 79 runs off 112 balls. He showed once again that he is one of the best batsmen in the world when it comes to leading from the front.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ravichandran Ashwin’s bowling: Ashwin was outstanding with both the bat and ball in this match. He picked up six wickets in South Africa’s first innings and then scored valuable runs down the order in India’s second innings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The partnership between Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane: This was arguably the most important factor in India’s victory. Kohli and Rahane batted sensibly and patiently against a formidable South African bowling attack to put up a 137-run partnership for the second wicket. This set the foundation for India’s total of 335 in their first innings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The performance of Bhuvneshwar Kumar: Kumar was brilliant with both the ball and bat in this match. He picked up four wickets in South Africa’s first innings and then scored 30 crucial runs down the order in India’s second innings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fielding performance of Team India: Indian fielders put up an excellent show throughout the match, catching everything that came their way. This helped them limit South Africa’s total score and eventually win the match.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Yuvraj-Singh-Stars-as-India-Wins-Series-Opener-with-a-Pair-of-Aces"><a href="#Yuvraj-Singh-Stars-as-India-Wins-Series-Opener-with-a-Pair-of-Aces" class="headerlink" title="Yuvraj Singh Stars as India Wins Series Opener with a Pair of Aces"></a>Yuvraj Singh Stars as India Wins Series Opener with a Pair of Aces</h1><p>In the first match of the five-game ODI series against Sri Lanka, India’s Yuvraj Singh starred with both bat and ball as they won by 89 runs. Singh hit 111 not out off 94 balls, his 18th century in ODIs, and then took 2 for 17 with his left-arm spin.</p>
<p>The win was set up by India’s strong batting performance, which posted 311 for 6 after being put in to bat by Sri Lanka. Opener Rohit Sharma scored a brisk 92 off 107 balls, while captain Virat Kohli contributed 59. In reply, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 222 in 45.2 overs. Kusal Mendis top-scored for them with 71, but no other batsman scored more than 25 as they suffered their first loss of the tour.</p>
<p>For Singh, the man-of-the-match award was a sweet way to celebrate his recall to the Indian team after being out of form for most of 2018. “I was just trying to stay calm and batted according to the situation,” he said after the match. “It is great to get some form back before the World Cup.”</p>
<p>The second ODI takes place at Dharamsala on Thursday.</p>
<h1 id="Indian-Cricket-Team-Bags-Series-against-Windies-with-Consecutive-Two-Ace-Wins"><a href="#Indian-Cricket-Team-Bags-Series-against-Windies-with-Consecutive-Two-Ace-Wins" class="headerlink" title="Indian Cricket Team Bags Series against Windies with Consecutive Two-Ace Wins"></a>Indian Cricket Team Bags Series against Windies with Consecutive Two-Ace Wins</h1><p>In what is being hailed as a stellar performance by the Indian Cricket Team, the Men in Blue have bagged the series against Windies with consecutive two-ace wins. The first win came in Rajkot, and the second in Hyderabad.</p>
<p>The game changer for India was undoubtedly the batting of Virat Kohli. He led from the front and scored centuries in both the matches, setting the tone for his team’s victory. His brilliantly crafted innings were not just about scoring runs but also about occupying the crease and demoralising the Windies bowlers.</p>
<p>Kohli was ably supported by Rohit Sharma, who also scored a century in Hyderabad, and by Shikhar Dhawan, who contributed significantly to India’s totals in both matches.</p>
<p>Jasprit Bumrah was once again impressive with his bowling, taking crucial wickets at important moments. He was ably supported by Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Kuldeep Yadav.</p>
<p>Thecombination of experienced players like Kohli and Sharma together with youngsters like Rishabh Pant and Prithvi Shaw has worked wonders for India so far this season. The team looks well-balanced and capable of beating any opposition on its day.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how India fares in the upcoming three-match ODI series against Australia. The Aussies are a strong side and will provide a challenging test for India. But if Kohli &amp; Co can maintain their current form, there is no reason why they cannot come out on top once again.</p>
<h1 id="Rohit-Sharma-Leads-India-to-a-Clean-Sweep-with-2-Back-To-Back-Aces"><a href="#Rohit-Sharma-Leads-India-to-a-Clean-Sweep-with-2-Back-To-Back-Aces" class="headerlink" title="Rohit Sharma Leads India to a Clean Sweep with 2 Back-To-Back Aces"></a>Rohit Sharma Leads India to a Clean Sweep with 2 Back-To-Back Aces</h1><p>Rohit Sharma played two back-to-back aces in the final T20I against Sri Lanka to take India to a clean sweep of the series.</p>
<p>This was Rohit Sharma’s first match since coming back from a calf injury, and he made sure that he made an impact right from the start. He came in to bat at number 3 and played some aggressive shots to take India to a good total.</p>
<p>Rohit Sharma’s innings helped India get to 180/5 in their 20 overs.</p>
<p>In the bowling department, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah were exceptional yet again. They picked up three wickets each to help restrict Sri Lanka to 158/9 in their 20 overs.</p>
<p>This was India’s ninth consecutive win on the tour of Sri Lanka, and it also meant that they ended the tour with a clean sweep.</p>
<p>This was Rohit Sharma’s first T20I series win as captain, and it would be interesting to see how he performs in future assignments.</p>

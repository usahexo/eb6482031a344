        <h1 id="Casino-Closes-its-Doors-after-Investigation-Reveals-Fraudulent-Activities"><a href="#Casino-Closes-its-Doors-after-Investigation-Reveals-Fraudulent-Activities" class="headerlink" title="Casino Closes its Doors after Investigation Reveals Fraudulent Activities"></a>Casino Closes its Doors after Investigation Reveals Fraudulent Activities</h1><p>The popular casino, which has been in business for over two decades, has abruptly closed its doors after an investigation revealed that its staff had been engaging in fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>According to the casino’s management, some of its employees had been colluding with players in order to ensure that they would win large sums of money. In some cases, employees had even been helping players to cheat the casino’s systems.</p>
<p>The closure of the casino has come as a major shock to its customers, who were not expecting such a turn of events. Many of them are now wondering what they are going to do with all the money they had stashed away in their accounts.</p>
<p>While the casino is not giving any reasons for its closure, it is believed that the authorities may have had a hand in it. It is possible that they were investigating the casino and its staff for some time before finally taking action.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a casino has been forced to close down due to fraudulent activities. In fact, it is becoming increasingly common for casinos to be targeted by scam artists. As a result, players need to be extra careful when deciding where to place their bets.</p>
<p>There are still plenty of honest casinos out there that offer fair games and pay out genuine winnings. So if you’re looking for a safe and reliable gambling experience, be sure to do your research before choosing one.</p>
<h1 id="300-Employees-Lay-off-After-Santa-Claran-Casino-Closes"><a href="#300-Employees-Lay-off-After-Santa-Claran-Casino-Closes" class="headerlink" title="300 Employees Lay off After Santa Claran Casino Closes"></a>300 Employees Lay off After Santa Claran Casino Closes</h1><p>The Santa Claran Casino was a mainstay in the town of Española for nearly 50 years. But on Wednesday, Oct. 17, it closed its doors for good, leaving 300 employees out of work.</p>
<p>Some of those employees had worked at the casino since it opened in 1969.</p>
<p>“It’s a hard pill to swallow,” said Jesse Montoya, who had been employed as a cook at the casino for 25 years. “I don’t know what I’m going to do now.”</p>
<p>The casino closure is the latest blow to Española, which has seen a number of businesses close in recent years. In addition to the layoffs, the closure will also have a ripple effect on the town’s economy, as employees spend their money at local businesses.</p>
<p>Owner Ray Martinez said the decision to close the casino was difficult but necessary.</p>
<p>“The writing was on the wall,” Martinez said. “We just couldn’t make it work anymore.” </p>
<p> Martinez blamed changing demographics and increased regulation for the closure. The latter has made it more difficult for casinos to operate profitably.</p>
<p>In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Gov. Susana Martinez said she was saddened by the news of the casino closure but thanked the workers for their years of service.</p>
<p>The Santa Claran Casino is one of five Native American casinos in New Mexico that have closed in recent years.</p>
<h1 id="5-Million-in-Fake-Chips-Discovered-at-Santa-Claran-Casino"><a href="#5-Million-in-Fake-Chips-Discovered-at-Santa-Claran-Casino" class="headerlink" title="$5 Million in Fake Chips Discovered at Santa Claran Casino"></a>$5 Million in Fake Chips Discovered at Santa Claran Casino</h1><p>On Sunday, the Santa Claran Casino in Española, New Mexico announced that it had discovered nearly $5 million worth of counterfeit casino chips. According to officials at the casino, the chips were found during a routine inventory check and were apparently printed in China.</p>
<p>The discovery of the fake chips is a major blow to the Santa Claran Casino, which has been struggling in recent years to compete with neighboring casinos in Taos and Raton. In a statement released on Sunday, casino officials said that they were working with local law enforcement to investigate the matter and planned to prosecute those responsible for producing the counterfeit chips.</p>
<p>“This is a major crime,” said casino spokesman Tony Congiardo in a statement to reporters. “We will not tolerate this type of behavior from anyone, and we are working aggressively with law enforcement to identify and prosecute those responsible.”</p>
<p>News of the discovery of the fake chips comes just weeks after officials at the Santa Claran Casino announced plans to close its doors later this year. The closure of the casino would leave Española without any gambling facilities, a major blow to the local economy.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Empire-Falls-as-Santa-Claran-Casino-Closes-Its-Doors"><a href="#Gambling-Empire-Falls-as-Santa-Claran-Casino-Closes-Its-Doors" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Empire Falls as Santa Claran Casino Closes Its Doors"></a>Gambling Empire Falls as Santa Claran Casino Closes Its Doors</h1><p>SANTA CLARA, CA - The Santa Claran Casino, once a shining jewel in the gambling empire of Nevada and a popular tourist destination for Bay Area residents, announced today that it will be closing its doors for good.</p>
<p>The closure comes as a surprise to many, as the casino had been doing well in recent months, thanks in part to the legalization of online poker in California. But an industry insider who declined to be identified said that the casino’s owner, Wooldridge Gaming LLC, may have overextended itself by taking on too much debt.</p>
<p>In a statement released to the media, Wooldridge Gaming LLC said that it was “saddened” to announce the closure but that it had no other choice. “We would like to thank our employees, customers and partners for their support over the years,” the statement read. “We hope that you will visit our other properties in the future.”</p>
<p>The closure is expected to have a ripple effect throughout the local economy, as the casino employed more than 700 people. The Santa Clara Convention and Visitors Bureau estimates that the casino generated $100 million annually for the local economy.</p>
<p>Word of the casino’s closure spread quickly on social media, with many people expressing their sadness at losing what had become an important part of their community. “This is so sad,” wrote one resident on Twitter. “My husband and I loved spending time at Santa Claran Casino.”</p>
<h1 id="Statewide-Manhunt-for-Crooked-Casino-Owner-Who-Cheated-Employees-and-Gamblers-Out-of-Millions"><a href="#Statewide-Manhunt-for-Crooked-Casino-Owner-Who-Cheated-Employees-and-Gamblers-Out-of-Millions" class="headerlink" title="Statewide Manhunt for Crooked Casino Owner Who Cheated Employees and Gamblers Out of Millions"></a>Statewide Manhunt for Crooked Casino Owner Who Cheated Employees and Gamblers Out of Millions</h1><p>Las Vegas, NV - Tuesday morning a statewide manhunt was issued for casino owner Christopher P. Matthews who is wanted for cheating employees and gamblers out of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department began investigating Matthews in July after several employees came forward with evidence that he had been skimming money from the casino’s profits. Investigators also discovered that Matthews had been rigging slot machines to payout more often than they should have, resulting in thousands of dollars in losses for unwitting gamblers.</p>
<p>Matthews was able to get away with his scheme for years due to his close relationships with several high-ranking police officers in the department. However, after his crimes were exposed, Matthews quickly fled the state and has been on the run ever since.</p>
<p>Authorities are asking for the public’s help in locating Matthews, who is believed to be hiding out somewhere in Nevada or California. He is considered to be armed and dangerous, so anyone who sees him should not attempt to apprehend him themselves.</p>
<p>Please contact the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department at 702-828-3111 if you have any information on Christopher P. Matthews’ whereabouts.</p>

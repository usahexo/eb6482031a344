<h1 id="What-do-I-need-to-know-to-Michael-Crichton-blackjack-menaphites"><a href="#What-do-I-need-to-know-to-Michael-Crichton-blackjack-menaphites" class="headerlink" title="What do I need to know to Michael Crichton blackjack menaphites?"></a>What do I need to know to Michael Crichton blackjack menaphites?</h1><p>Players will find that the blackjack games available at many online casinos are closely modeled after the games found in traditional casinos. The goal of each player is still to draw cards totaling 21, or as close to 21 as possible, without going over.</p>
<p>When playing blackjack in an online casino, you’ll first need to select a game and open an account. You can then make a deposit and select your betting amount. Blackjack is typically played with six decks of cards, so make sure you know the bet minimum and maximum for the game you choose.</p>
<p>Once the game starts, players are dealt two cards face up. The dealer also receives two cards, one face up and one face down. Players then have the option to hit (draw another card), stand (play with the cards they’ve been dealt), double down (double their bet and receive one more card), split (split two identical cards into two separate hands) or buy insurance (insurance bets are placed when the dealer’s upcard is an ace).</p>
<p>The goal is to draw cards totaling 21, or as close to 21 as possible, without going over. If your first two cards total 21, you’ve “bust” and lose your bet regardless of what the dealer does. If your first two cards total 11 or less, you should always hit - even if the dealer has a low card showing.</p>
<p>If your first two cards are different values (for example, an eight and a queen), you have the option of splitting them into two separate hands by placing another bet equal to your original wager. You’ll then play each hand separately. If either hand goes over 21, you lose that entire hand - even if the other hand is still playable.</p>
<p>If the dealer has an ace showing and you think they may have a strong hand (total of 17 or more), you can take insurance by betting an amount equal to half your original bet. If the dealer has blackjack (an ace and any other card value of 10), you’ll lose your insurance bet but still win your original bet amount. If the dealer doesn’t have blackjack, you’ll lose both bets - original and insurance.</p>

Menaphites is one his blackjack books, where he offers methods and techniques on how to beat the casino at their own game and make money in the process. In this article, we are going to take a look at some of the concepts from the book so that you can apply them to your next trip to the casino.</p>
<p>The first basic principle that Crichton talks about is playing percentages. This means betting in proportion to the odds of winning. For example, if you are betting on blackjack, you should bet more when the odds are in your favour, and less when they are not. You can use this rule in other casino games as well by adjusting your bets accordingly.</p>
<p>Another important concept is that of risk and reward. In general, you want to risk as little as possible while still achieving a desirable reward. For example, you might want to make smaller bets when the odds are against you but increase them when the odds are in your favour. This will help ensure that you don’t lose too much money if you do happen to lose a few hands.</p>
<p>Crichton also recommends using basic strategy for all of your blackjack plays. This involves making the best decision possible based on the cards that are currently showing. By using basic strategy, you can minimise the house edge and give yourself a better chance of winning overall.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s important to keep track of your progress while playing casino games. This means recording both your wins and losses so that you can figure out how profitable each game is for you. By doing this, you can adjust your betting strategy accordingly and maximise your profits over time.</p>

Let’s take a look at how it works!</p>
<p>The Michael Crichton menaphite blackjack method is based on the fact that the dealer has to hit on soft 17. This means that they can potentially bust, which gives players an advantage. To use this strategy, you need to first figure out whether the dealer is likely to bust or not.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to keep track of the cards that have already been played. If there are a lot of high cards still in play, then the dealer is more likely to bust. If there are lots of low cards still in play, then the dealer is less likely to bust. You can use this information to make smart decisions about when to hit and when to stand.</p>
<p>Another important element of this strategy is knowing when to double down. When you double down, you are doubling your bet and only getting one more card. This is a risky move, but it can pay off if the card is favourable. For example, if you have an 11 and the dealer has a 2 showing, you might want to double down – because there is a good chance that the dealer will bust.</p>
<p>One last thing to keep in mind with this strategy is insurance bets. An insurance bet is when you put money down on the chances that the dealer has blackjack (an ace and a king, queen or jack). If they do have blackjack, then your insurance bet pays out 2:1 – so it’s definitely worth considering if the odds are favourable.</p>

But step over to the blackjack tables and it’s a different story. The air turns serious, the dealers are poker-faced, and behind the tables you can see security guards keeping a close eye on everyone.</h3><p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games, and it’s easy to see why. It’s simple to learn but offers plenty of opportunity for strategic play. At first glance, the game seems pretty straightforward - you bet on whether or not your hand will beat the dealer’s, and if you come closer to 21 than the dealer without going over, you win.</p>
<p>But there’s more to it than that. The odds change as cards are revealed, so experienced players can take advantage of this by making calculated bets. And then there are card counting techniques which allow players to know when they have an edge over the house.</p>
<p>All of this makes blackjack one of the most challenging games in the casino - and one that can be beaten with a bit of skill. In this article, we’re going to look at one blackjack strategy that has been used by professional gamblers for years: Michael Crichton’s blackjack menaphites technique.</p>
<p>Crichton was an American author and screenwriter who wrote several popular books about gambling, including [Zero] ([<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zero-Michael-Crichton/dp/B001ETLFV4%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIWOWYYGZ4PTVA4UA%26tag%3Donemanwonder-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001ETLFV4]">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zero-Michael-Crichton/dp/B001ETLFV4%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIWOWYYGZ4PTVA4UA%26tag%3Donemanwonder-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001ETLFV4]</a>). His blackjack strategy is based on an old Egyptian counting system that he learned while researching his book. It’s not a perfect system, but it does give players an advantage over the house if used correctly.</p>
<p>To use Crichton’s blackjack menaphites technique, you need to first familiarise yourself with the basic rules of blackjack:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over</li>
<li>You can bet on whether your hand will beat the dealer’s or not</li>
<li>Cards 2-10 are worth their face value</li>
<li>Aces are worth 1 or 11 (your choice)</li>
<li>Kings, Queens and Jacks are all worth 10</li>
<li>The suits of cards don’t matter</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’re familiar with these rules, you can start using Crichton’s technique. Here’s how it works:</p>
<pre><code>           Assume there are six decks in use and begin by betting one unit on each hand (so you&#39;ll be betting 12 units in total).



           On the first hand, keep track of how many aces have been played so far (including those that have been removed from play). If there have been two or more aces played so far, then stand no matter what your current hand value is (this is known as &#39;standing Menaphite&#39;). If there has only been one ace played so far then continue playing according to regular blackjack strategy (except when your current hand value is 6 or below - see below).



           If your current hand value is 6 or below and an ace has already been played, then hit even if standing Menaphite would be better (since you want to try and get as close to 21 as possible). This may seem counterintuitive but it&#39;s important to remember that at this point in the game other cards may have already been removed from play which would alter the odds if you stood. For example, if you had a hand value of 5 and were playing against a dealer who had a 4 showing, then standing would be better since there would only be one more ace left in the deck. However, if another card was drawn from the deck before your next turn - such as a 10 - then standing would actually lose since your new hand value would be 16 (5 + 10 = 15 ; 16 &gt; 15). By hitting instead when playing against a 4 showing dealer, you&#39;re increasing your chances of getting closer to 21 without going bust.
